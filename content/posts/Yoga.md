Yoga was not taught in my school... or high school or collage. Stretching was taught super early. I would say Yoga is similar to swimming. Stretching is similar to perhaps weight lifting, where its super specific, and you have to learn the correct way.  

Yoga and swimming are so similar with breathing and pretty much the flow. If you don't do it regularly, it can be a wakeup for your body.

Stretching is strange, I am not really big into it. I like my foam roller, but its not something I will do even before a long run or workout. 

I like video yoga Classes but in person classes are preferred
