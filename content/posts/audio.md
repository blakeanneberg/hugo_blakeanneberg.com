I have been going back and forth about getting a smart speaker. I miss music in the morning, and miss it in the evening. So I checked again and its out of stock.

I have no regrets in buying nice earbuds. Love noise canceling and music when running.

I would love to have a MP3 player for the pool. Havent really hunted for a deal on those.

I also like my speakers in my car, but would love to upgrade those with a better subwoofer.
