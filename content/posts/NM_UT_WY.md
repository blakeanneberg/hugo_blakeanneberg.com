I cant wait to inlcude these passenger rail routes. But first I need to go back and visit them in person. 

During our dev meeting today, we talked about going the extra mile, and the dev re-phrased it as "Travel extra trip, its always worth it." 

I think doing a road trip to these locations would be worth the extra trip.
