The idea is to make a app that can be used on a phone where it will track door lock installs. Features:

*   Connect to a API for hardware components etc
*   Be able to export to CSV or spreadsheet
*   Take photos and save media
*   Real time CRUD database
*   Drop pins on a blueprint overlay
*   Be able to add other data like access control for groups etc
*   Project track site survey, fabrication, change orders, show a visual timeline, install and track completion tasks.

Goal of the app for myself:

*   Be able to put all my learnings of Go, SQL and cloud hosing into action
*   Contribute to open source and manage a open source project
*   Gain project management skills
*   Sell addons or other features as a way to earn money. Advertise servieces from venders or consulants.
*   Offer a tip jar or way for support/payment
