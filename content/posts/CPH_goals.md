I am really stoked to be doing two races in CPH. My goals are two part.

1. Spend more time in CPH and hopefully find a job/opportunity.
2. Have two big races to structure my life around and also have a regime for training over the winter. 

There are alot of spin off goals and things that will occure with the two above goals.

- Learn Danish
- Try and find a new job
- Travel around more in Denmark.
- Have a plan for the winter.
- Do another Ironman

So while its a big goal, I am looking forward to it re-setting alot of goals and priorities.

Ultimate goals would still be working on all of my side projects and other goals, but this will be an addition that will hopefully strucutre those side projects better.
