I think about backyards alot. 

Whether its putting in a veggie garden or a organic pool, or both. 

I dream about things that happen in backyards, sometimes they are bad dreams of tornado's or zombies. 

My dream backyard would have a veggie garden, a 25 yard organic pool, and a shower. 

I would like a trees, but I don't often think about them. When I do think about trees they are fruit trees. I think Cherry and Apple would be great. Or the smell of orange or grapefruit trees. 

I would like Jasmine plants too.

I wish I had a backyard to test these ideas out.
