I saw a news show about a Tempe development that is only by foot. They had dirt paths between the buildings to keep air cool and allow for rain to drain. 

The interviewees said it felt like a small village in Italy or France. 

I really like this community concept. 

Also they had basically no parking for the people that lived there, just parking for some stores that are on the ground level. All the houses were two or maybe three stories tall. It had a really nice walkable feel. 

Anyway, as I run commute to work, I think I would like that.
