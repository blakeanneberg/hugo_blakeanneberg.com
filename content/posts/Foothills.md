I really like the view from i70 right at the start of the foothills.

Its looking south to the Palmer Divide in in the distance you can see Pikes Peak. 

Usually I am traveling in the afternoon and the dust in the air picks up the shadows and light coming from the south which gives it a prehistoric look as there are no human buildings in the distance. 

I haven't really spent any time in the foothills, which are very dry right now.

I do have one memories from a field trip to Colorado Springs where we stopped at a classmates grandparents house that was in the foothills and they had a pool which was designed like a Roman bath with the pool in the center and two of the sides had buildings  and overhangs, and the third side was a view looking east over the foothills.
