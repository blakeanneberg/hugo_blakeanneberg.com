I want to write about how there are really simple UI indi games out (like the game Turmoil) there right now and I am really excited by how they look and how easy it is to interact with them and use your imagination. 

Like in '90s video games, the pixel art left alot to the imagination and I think that is a good thing. 

The second thing is that I get PDF newsletters in email from groups supporting passenger rail. These are full of information and will act as a great record of history for building the rail game. However, the photos and maps in these are often pixilated and really hard to see. Its unfortunate as its hard to understand what they are trying to convey, and it would have been better to just make artwork.
