I have a lot of different seed packets, and I need to start using them.

I thought I would do this over the summer and have plants on the deck. But I got really busy and did not start them.

So its looking more and more likely that I will do them indoors over Fall and Winter. 

Not sure if this is a good idea. But I have all the equipment and soil. 

So there might be a interesting experiment in getting these to grow.
