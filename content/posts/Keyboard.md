Its hard re-learning how to type on a new Kenesis Advantage 2 QD keyboard. However, its much better on my wrists. But I will try and keep using it every day. My first thought when taking notes is how much I have to look down at my fingers and then how I am using my fingers to type with the incorrect finger per key. Always overwhelming learning new things but glad I am doing it.

Now just making git to wrap all my commands of \`G add .\`, \`G commit -m "message I am typing out"\`, \`git push\` into one command.
