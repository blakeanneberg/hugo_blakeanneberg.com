I really cannot remmeber quotes and lyrics word for word. 

The reason I think about this is I heard a good quote today.

> Know thy enemy and know the outcome of 1,000 battles.

The quote was on a strava post and was about a barbell workout.

Otherwise I like running on the treadmill and listening to music with the lyrics displayed. 

Keeps me occupied and keeps it going.
