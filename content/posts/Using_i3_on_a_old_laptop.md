On a old Dell laptop I have Fedora installed and usually I use GNOME but I also have i3.

I love i3. I wish I had it on another computer as I love just having three workspaces and just need something that is fast. They are usually Firefox, Terminal/Alacrity with Neovim/SSH/TMUX and the third workspace is a mix of terminal and browser. I really enjoy i3 and wish I had it on my work computer as its windows and it gets in the way of me being productive. Some other reasons I like i3:

*   Helps me focus as I kinda mono tast more on each workspaces
*   Helps me learn something new and makes me feel better as I have improved workflows.
*   The minimum OS gives me better battery levels and keeps my laptop running cool and quiet.

So for various reasons, I want to get better at i3 and I will always come back to using it in the future.
