Well in getting back to study, I am now wondering whether to continue with Network+ or go with CCNA. 

Main reasons for this is that I feel the CCNA is a bit easier to learn. The study materials just make more sense. 

Also, I am not liking the CompTia Network Plus study materials but rather CCNA by Wendell Odom. 

A couple more cross roads are: 

1. Buy mountain bike or continue with road bike.
2. Colorado Rail Game or study for Network+/CCNA.
3. Straw Bale house YouTube or more work camps for skills.
4. Finding remote work or in person work. 
5. Kids book in Vail or study IT.
6. Be content and focus on small number of projects or keep planning many projects. 

So just need to plan out next course of action and re-read sections of books about stoics and see what they would do.
