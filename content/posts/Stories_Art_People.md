In making the vie game, I am so excited about the kinds of stories I can share, the artwork of the locations and the characters that a player will come across.

It is so different to make up things and share them. 

Creating a video game requires so much creativity and technical know how. It can really tie together so many mediums. You don't need a lot of space, expensive gear or materials.Just a lot of creativity.
