For some time I have been wanting to have a in person store that sells Saysky clothing, has coffee/snacks and sells scandi/local stuff.

In the store I could also have nice cups as I see a similarity between Royal Copenhagen porcelain and Saysky running clothes and celebrates educational video games and shows space events live.

The Royal Copenhagen and Saysky connection are:

1. Both have seasonal designs, patterns and run for a limited time.
2. Both are luxury life style brands. They run pretty expensive. 
3. They do not often bring back designs.
4. Both lean into their Scandinavian heritage. 

The video game and space shows connection are that I have also been thinking that I can do some part time work in educational video game niche and having space events on TV/Projected could be better than showing regular sports. 

The educational video game guiding plan could be this: 

- Finish the CO Rail game UXIU. 
- Start a crowdfunding campaign for dev costs and to get interest. Release on steam?
- The first theme will be current day in Colorado
- Second theme will be historical in Colorado
- Third theme would be futuristic in Colorado
- Fourth theme would be a current day journey in Ukraine  
- Fifth theme would be historical in Japan (shinkansen)
- Sixth theme would be futuristic in Europe with a hyperloop by Hardt or SwissPod

Finally, the goal would be a store where I could build it with straw bale methods, and then live above the store. Not sure where the organic pool would go, but glad to figure out a start from just running clothes. 

I envision a unique store that combines several passions:

# Saysky Clothing: 
A curated selection of Saysky running apparel.
# Coffee & Snacks: 
A cozy cafe serving high-quality coffee and light bites.
# Scandi & Local Goods: 
Featuring a carefully chosen assortment of Scandinavian and locally-made products.


# Unique Experiences:
- Nordic Connection: Showcase beautiful ceramics, drawing parallels between the limited-edition, seasonal designs and the exclusivity of Saysky.
- Educational Video Games: Host events and workshops related to educational gaming, potentially focusing on a series of games centered around Colorado (present, historical, futuristic).
- Space Events: Live stream space events, offering an alternative to traditional sports viewing.

# Educational Video Game Development:

## UXIU Completion: 
Finalize the user experience for the CO Rail game.
## Crowdfunding Campaign: 
Launch a campaign to fund development costs and gauge public interest.
## Steam Release: 
Plan for initial release on the Steam platform.

# Game Themes: 
1. Current Day Colorado
2. Historical Colorado
3. Futuristic Colorado
4. Current Day Ukraine
5. Historical Japan (Shinkansen)
6. Futuristic Europe (Hyperloop)

# Store Vision:

## Sustainable Construction: 
Build the store using eco-friendly straw bale methods.
## Live-Work Space: 
Incorporate a living space above the store.
## Organic Pool: 
Explore the possibility of including an organic pool (location to be determined).

# Key Takeaways:

- This concept blends a love for running apparel, Scandinavian design, and innovative experiences.
- The educational video game component adds a unique and engaging dimension.
- The focus on sustainability with straw bale construction aligns with the overall vision.kkk

# Further Considerations:

## Market Research: 
Conduct thorough market research to assess the viability and potential success of this concept.
## Funding Strategy: 
Develop a comprehensive funding strategy to support the store's establishment and ongoing operations.
## Community Engagement: 
Plan community events and partnerships to foster local support and build a loyal customer base.
