After the creative writing meetup, I was interested on what is a story and who is the storyteller. 
I organially joined just to become a better writer. But quickly its becoming a way to be  a better story teller.

When we first read or learn a story, we automatically become story tellers by retelling the story. This retelling is important as our version will probably be different than the original story. 

If a person changes the story to deceive, it might be a form of manipulation of the story. Its always hard to know what bits of the story might be made up, even if the corpus remains true. But if its just a story does it matter? is and often written down, when being read we can miss read and come to a different conclusion. Otherwise, when we read a story, we can get a completely different meaning. 

Looking forward to being more of a storyteller in the future.
