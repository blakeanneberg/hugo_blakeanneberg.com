After the creative writing meetup, I was interested in what constitutes a story and who is the storyteller. I originally joined just to become a better writer, but it's quickly becoming a way to be a better storyteller.

When we first read or learn a story, we automatically become storytellers by retelling it. This retelling is important, as our version will probably be different from the original story.

If a person changes the story to deceive, it might be a form of manipulation. It's always hard to know what bits of the story might be made up, even if the main point remains true. But if it's just a story, does it matter? It often is written down, and when we read, we can misread and come to a different conclusion. We can get a completely different meaning from the one intended.

Looking forward to being more of a storyteller in the future.
