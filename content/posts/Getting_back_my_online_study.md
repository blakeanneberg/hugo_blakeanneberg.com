Been busy with work so that in the evening I don't have energy to study my online courses. I am finally getting back to online learning after taking about 7 days off.

Doing the SQL and Tableau courses are shorter so I really need to study hard to finish them both.

I go back to Python on Boot.Dev to keep my coding knowledge stills fresh but I do miss Go on Coursera, as I want to make my website with Go. I also miss CS50, which is a hard course, but I think I will be ready epically after Boot.Dev.

I think to help me study more, I want either a MacBook Air or a System76 laptop with Linux, preferably Debian. I want something light and fast, and I don't want a kickstand like on a Surface Pro.
