I learned about about FTP and how important a measure it is when assessing workouts and life fitness. During the FTP test, you have to hit maximum effort to measure the about of Co2 and o2, which is not very fun to do. But the end result is a number that is unique and you will be able to plan workouts better. 

Otherwise, how does FTP and video game development have in common? Not alot, but I wish there was. I feel that Game development is like exercising without knowing FTP. Its hard making video games, I feel that exercising is easier. 

At least having a routine of exercising and learning game dev skills is probably more important that sprinting and cramming.
