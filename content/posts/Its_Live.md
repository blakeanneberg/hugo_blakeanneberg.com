I am excited to say that I can see CRG on Steam.

I didnt really think this day would arrive, but it is really here, and its live.

I am really greatful to have had the time, money and work contacts to get this published. 

I really cant wait to get it out of "coming soon" mode and published for download.

Only two items I wish were different... 

1. The game had linux and Steam Deck support on release. 
2. That I had a bit time and money to release more features at launch.

Now look forward to a merch store to wear something tanagible from the game.
