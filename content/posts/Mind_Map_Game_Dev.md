I have been using Jira for all my todo's but I was reminded from a YouTube, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1TzYZ6kf8U, and that you can use a Mind Map for task management. 

I really like it as I can see my tasks easier and I can see all the tasks in one view. 

There were so many Jira tasks, I was having hard time seeing everything. Having things in mind map I can now move things around and op and close things better. 

I also have alot of notes in the form of tasks. These notes have links and have reminders for content that I want to include in the game. So moving these notes to mind map will be nice as well.
