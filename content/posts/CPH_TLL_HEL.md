More than half way though the journey and races. Things I learned in CPH:
- Biking is fun and easy
- Going with gut feeling and pushing hard in the marathon was successful 
- Learn more about recycling 
- Train journeys are fun
- Spa day is fun

Things I learned I learned in TLL:
- Traveling with friend is better than being by myself
- Bog running is fun
- Waterfall is nice but with a mint chocolate hot chocolate with waterfall is nicer
- Tallinn is easy and nice to visit 

Cant wait to learn more in HEL.
