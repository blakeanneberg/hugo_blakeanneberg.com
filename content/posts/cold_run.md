I said that I would just run around the park. Thats it. Its not even a mile. 

I started running up a small narrow uphill. Half way around a curve there was a walker slowing moving up the path. So I had to walk half the uphill. 

Next I decided to head downhill and around. This is when the first sharp bite of cold happened. Luckily I had a hat but I did not have any gloves. 

Anyway I continued a whole loop around the park, even continued the normal up hill, and finally finished. I am glad I did it.
