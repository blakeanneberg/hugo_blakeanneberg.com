Its been a number of months since I first purchased my Godot learning course. Finally this week I have sat down and started to learn it. With all tutorials, its pretty slow going at first. But its forcing me to think creatively and learning something new is always fun.

I purhcased the course on GameDev.TV and then they had more sales so I purchased a drawing course, and a Blender course, pixle art course which Ill learn Asprite. 

So I am really excited learning three software packages, Godot, Blender and Asprite. I am also going to be practisting my Git control, and hopefully use my drawing pad to draw in Asprite.

I was tempted to purchase a audio course, on music production and sound effects... but thats probably too over my head. 

Finally I want to learn video VJ Resolume Avenu software.I was tempted to purchase a audio course, on music production and sound effects... but thats probably too over my head.
