Its been a number of months since I first purchased my Godot learning course. Finally this week I have sat down and started to learn it. With all tutorials, its pretty slow going at first. But its forcing me to think creatively and learning something new is always fun.

I purchased the course on GameDev.TV and then they had more sales so I purchased a drawing course, and a Blender course, pixel art course which Ill learn Asprite. 

So I am really excited learning three software packages, Godot, Blender and Asprite. I am also going to be practising my Git control, and hopefully use my drawing pad to draw in Asprite.

I was tempted to purchase a audio course, on music production and sound effects... but that's probably too over my head. 

Finally I want to learn video VJ Resolume Avenu software.I was tempted to purchase a audio course, on music production and sound effects... but that's probably too over my head.
