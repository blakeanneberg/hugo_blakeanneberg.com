I am interested about Kubernetes as I keep watching Youtube videos about linux and also want to learn about Docker and containers, so this week at work I learned about Ansible for Cisco networking equipment. I didn't really know the difference between all these technologies, so I stumbled across this metaphor after Googling for the differences between them: 

For a room: "Terraform builds the room, Ansible furnishes the room and Kubernetes manages the room's operation."

For a house: "Terraform builds the house's infrastructure, Ansible furnishes and configures the interior, and Kubernetes acts as the property manager that ensures everything inside keeps running smoothly."

For my own room, I would say a desk is perhaps the most important area in the room. Needs electrical, space, and good light.

Second ares are perhaps the bed. Needs space for getting in and out on either side, good light for reading and turning off the light and not close to the cold window. 

Finally least important is the clothes area as it usually becomes a dumping ground into the hamper. 

So not sure how to make my own room more efficient but if I get more rooms, I could definitely automate and extend across multiple locations.
