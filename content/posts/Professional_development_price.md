I re-upped with Testout and paid for all their course cataloge. 
Not only is Network+ top course but ohers like Linux, Cyber, and Hybrid Server.

I am glad I signed up even though if feels expensive. 

I am also glad to be writing this post on a steam deck. just need a better keyboard as the shift button is so small on the right.

I should be sure to take the cert tests, but I am glad to be a life long learner.

In other news, I had a great day and week.
