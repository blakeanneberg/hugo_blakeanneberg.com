She is gone. It was really nice meeting all her friends. Today coincided with the task of learning Memento Mori, "Remember we are mortal."

Its actually a deliberate practice to know that we could be gone at any moment and that we should be energized by urgency to live life more fully. To be more intentional, more urgent and more appreciative of life.  

"Love more deeply, create more boldly, forgive more quickly, and live more fully."

So it is important to live for today and not wait for tomorrow.
