I pretty much finished the main plot line of a video game last night. 

This is the second game that I have finished the main plot line, and in both cases I was primarly motovated by gaining access to the highest power level.

So perhaps that is a good thing to learn from when I am thinking about the Colorado Rail Game.

If I were to have a winning scenerio as having the most "power" or having the ability to travel in the train with a "first class" fare, that might be motovating for people to play the game.

Anyway, these two recent video game wins were open world games and the kind of game the the rail game will be will not be a open world game, but rather text-based strategy video game. 

So I look forward to competing my own video game for my own win.
