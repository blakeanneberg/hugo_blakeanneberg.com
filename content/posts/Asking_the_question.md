Today I had a common theme of asking the question. 

- In a meeting, I asked the same question twice for someone to answered it.
- In a group chat for a project management technical apprenticeship program I asked if anybody wants to join me in making docs and templates.
- I asked open ended questions in emails.
- I asked where I could get information from another team.

So, never be afraid to ask questions.
