Glad to have a new rutine in run commute, take a shower, eat cusuant and have latte and then do some online study.

I did some subnetting practice problems and got some wrong answers. But I am learning and its good practice. Also glad to see people.

Run commute is not super long but its not easy to wake up and do it as it was kinda chilly. I am also glad to get steps in and get some sunlight in.

Now that the run commute is good, I have afternoons and I feel accomplished to have gotten some study in.
