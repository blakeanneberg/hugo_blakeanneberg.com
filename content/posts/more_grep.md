I needed to remember how to find a grep command that I used in the past so I did a `Ctrl` + `r` and then typed in `grep` and I found I had used `grep -rco "searchterm"` and then whaterver I searched for.

So I have to be in the directory that all the files I need to search in are in, which is a bit of a hassle, but its quick and shows me count of how many occurances the word is in each file.  

Really happy about it. Also happy about tmux, I have my old blog post in one window and then in another window I have this blog post, and in another bigger window I have my notes from the textbook. 

Also I am using NeoVim to edit these markdown files. So I feel like a power user right now.
