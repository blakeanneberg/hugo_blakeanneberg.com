I have always enjoyed space and watching videos about live stream of rocket launches and videos about space exploration.

I also love video games about space like Starfield and Civ Alpha Centauri and Surviving Mars.

I just wish we could have more robotic exploration of  all the planets of the solar system. 

Like have a live webcam satellites at each planet.
