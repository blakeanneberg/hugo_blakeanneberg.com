Seeing a comet is really a rare joy. Since there is one up right now, and it wont be visible for another 80,000 years or if ever, it really made makes me think of those timelines which are so hard to understand and grasp. A space.com article said it is making its "first and last appearance."

The brief nature of the comet for us on earth made me think of all the cool aspen leaves that I have seen on the ground this fall. The leaves are sometimes red, but then the center vein's are yellow and extend outward. They too are so brief, that you have to go out and look at them or else you miss it.

Seeing these colors and knowing that we need to celebrate nature and be close to it, I sometimes think of owning a house with rooms that are the colors of all the natural colors outside. Like green from pine trees, blue from the sky, white from snow, and then orange and yellow from aspen tree etc. 

Thats also why I like sustainable construction techniques that use natural materials and colors of the seasons. 

I feel that my home will be able to help the earth again in the future.
