Seeing a comet is really a rare joy. Since there is one up right now, and it wont be visible for another 80,000 years if ever, it really made makes me thing of those time scales which are so hard to understand and grasp. A space.com article said it is making its "first and last appearance."

This made me think of all the cool aspen leaves that I have seen on the ground. The leaves are sometimes red, but then the center vein's are yellow and extend outward. They too are so brief, that you have to go out and look at them or else you miss it. I sometimes think of owning a house with rooms that are the colors of all the natural colors outside. Like green from pine trees, blue from the sky, white from snow, and then orange and yellow from aspen tree etc. 

Thats also why I like sustainable construction techniques that use natural colors of the seasons.
