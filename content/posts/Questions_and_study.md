In a meeting today I apologised for the emails asking for more clarification and asking questions. I was told it was better to ask questions than not. 

I am in the deep end of networking study for the CCNA and I just bought a book that I have no idea about, cybersecurity.

But I am going to ask the questions anyway and power though the awkward parts of learning.
