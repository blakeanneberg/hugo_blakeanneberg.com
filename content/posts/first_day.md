First day at a new job. I will have worked at some of the biggest employers in the small town. 

First day doing a full run commute, and weight training by doing 10 push-ups, 10 sit ups and 10 squats and then farmer carry two 45 pound kettlebell four times around this afternoon. 

Still doing alot of other non-first day things like writing this post and study on Boot.Dev.

Also trying no to put too much stress into keeping the streak up.
