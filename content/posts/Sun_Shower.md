Had all the seasons yesterday and today. From 81 to 28 in 24 hours. 

Saw no clouds yesterday to today driving in a near whiteout.

I was biking and working how fast I was going to get sun burnt. Then I was swimming and wondering if I was going to be chilled. 

I liked being warm and having the wind keep me cool. I like seeing the sun shower illuminate the new green leaves of the trees.
