First draft:

I want to share some of the things I have learned from someone.

1. How to write cursive. She had amazing handwriting, and from her practicing with me the curisve letters I still write some of them from her form.
2. Jokes. She had a great way of telling jokes.
3. Laughing. She wanted to see you laugh, which made her laugh more and made me laugh more. 
4. Travel. She traveled with groups and would not pass up the opportunity to visit places. 
5. Lotion. She had amazing soft hands and took really good care of them. 
6. Cameras and videography. She could really use a camera and also was great at documentng the scene, with her digital camera she took 10s of thousands of photos. She documented what we had for breafast.
7. Sweeping. She swept and kepts things clean and tidy. 
8. She would teach. She bought two jasmin plants for in front of the garage, and she plucked a small white flower from one and let me smell it noting that they dont produce alot of flowers but the ones they do smell really good. 
9. Strong. She was really strong. We would compare bicepts and she would tell me I have strong legs. 
10. Being humble. She would often say "I am just so glad..." and that would make me feel so good. 

So I am so glad I could share these antidotes.

Third draft:

I want to share some of the lessons I learned from my Grandma L.

The beauty of handwriting: She had the most elegant cursive and she could write so small words. I still use some of the flourishes she taught me in my own cursive.  

The joy of laughter: L had a wonderful way of telling jokes. She always wanted to see you smile, and that made everyone around her happier. What did the cat need when it wasn't feeling well? A purr-scripton! Then she would follow up saying "Do your co-workers know that. I am 96 year old ??"

The spirit of adventure: She embraced opportunities to travel, always eager learn, explore and experience new things. I enjoyed her driving me "off road" in her own golf cart! 

The importance of self-care: She had the softest skin, a testament to her dedication to self-care.

The art of capturing memories: L was a passionate photographer, documenting everything from our breakfasts to the most beautiful landscapes. She had full confidence using the camera.

She emailed: She used different kinds of text colors, different kinds of fonts, and signed off with emojis. Her emails were great. 

The value of a clean home: She kept her home spotless, teaching me the importance of order, a tidy space and sweeping. 

Appreciating the simple things: I'll never forget her showing me a delicate jasmine flower from two jasmine planters she purchased that were placed outside the garage. Teaching me to savor the small moments of beauty and to seek them out.

The strength within: L was incredibly strong, both physically and emotionally. She often commented me on my strong legs, and I commented that she had very strong biceps.

The power of gratitude: She often expressed her gratitude, a simple act that always made me feel valued and loved.

I am so grateful for these memories and the profound impact she had on my life.
