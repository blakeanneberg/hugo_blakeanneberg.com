Its around 7 AM in the morning... and I am writing this instead of learning on Boot.dev. 

I really want to start the practice of getting up early and doing code.

The Python loop section I am on got really hard, or I forgot what the core concept was... so I have to go back and re-learn loops.

Or I wonder if I just go back to the start with Python. 

Anyway, if I had learned coding back in the day, I would be a in a different job today. I really keep coming back to developing again.

My first was a flash card app, Confident Dyslexic App. It enabled me to get my foot in the door with Tech.

Developing my own online course has helped me remember that I can do big projects too: https://www.udemy.com/course/building-accessible-online-courses/?kw=building+accessible+online+courses&src=sac

Finally doing the Colorado Rail game will mix alot of Development/code with content. I am glad its coming full circle in making an app.

Now if only I could start doing code early in the morning.
