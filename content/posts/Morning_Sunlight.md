Cannot overstate how much I like sunlight. 

While reading a brief section about Onsens in Letter from Japan by Marie Kondo, she descrubes a dawn ceder bath experience. It was such a nice image in my mind by the way she described the light coming though and the wood, steam and water sounds. 

Truely a wonderful experience in life is that orange light of the morning coming in though the windows and being able to wake up, warm up, and feel refreshed so early in the morning.
