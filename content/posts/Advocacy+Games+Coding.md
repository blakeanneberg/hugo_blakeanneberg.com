I was in the pool and thinking of how I can combine many different hobbies and learn how to code. So I came up with a project:

*   Online and free
*   Similar to Oregon Trail, as it will be pixel based and have story lines for the choices you make.
*   Take donations and be able to sell merch
*   Will help me learn to code
*   Be able to do some public advocacy for sustainable transportation for Colorado.
*   Might allow me to do it full time and be able to travel as I can interview people, be my own boss, and allow me to do something I am passionate about.
*   Will allow me to do more YouTube stuff like live streams and edited clips.

I had previously written about my goal for an open source app for myself but I think this one project has more possible benefits:

*   Be able to put all my learnings of Go, SQL, Python and cloud hosing into action
*   Contribute to open source my own project and manage open source my own project
*   Gain project management skills
*   Sell add-ons or other features as a way to earn money. Advertise services from vendors or consultants.
*   Offer a tip jar or way for support/payment

Also, after doing a bit of research, I could use [Ren'Py](https://renpy.org) to get story lines set up and then code it to include a map and rel time visualization of trains. I am just really excited to be able to have one project that interests me on so many levels. I was also listening [to this video on how to get a developer job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nz8GXjxiHg&t=12949s) and clearly having one big project that is worked on with fully is better than many projects.
