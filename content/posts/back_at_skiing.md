I cant believe I haven't skied for so long. I am glad I was able to again, but also I dont think I missed it so much.

Also I am back at learning networking. I am really glad to be starting it again but also these two textbooks are huge. I cant wait to finish them.

I also forgot how to do subnetting and that will need to re-learn it a certain amount. 

Otherwise I am glad I can ski again but I am wanting to skin up the mountain more.
