I went runnning on  the tradmill again to get ready for the marathons and what struck me was how borning it was. I wsas constantly loking at my phone and changing music. 

So I thought I should use a ipad to study my courses on coursera. So after setting up bluetooth headphones I was able to study TCP/IP and Hotel Financials course. It was great. 
I was going pretty slow and it made my ipad to have 75% battery, but after two hours I had done alot of study. 

Going forward, its nice to have some kind of thing to do while on the treadmill. Good to finally figure out this.
