Before I write about the blog title, I wanted to replace in Neovim the underlines of _ with spaces of my Hugo markdown file title name which is ```title: "One Game Loop Multiple Games" ``` so after a bit of googling I figure out that its ``` :%s/_/ /gc ```. 

Right now I am listing to VLE Radio Suomi Helsinki and its all in Finnish and sounds kinda country music. 

I wish I knew Finish and Swedish, Danish and Norwegian. 

Anyway the main brain wave of the day is to use the Colorado Rail Game game engine for multiple other games.

I am hitting the triple constraint of time, money and scope. I don't have enough money and time to work on three games (CO Rail Game, Sauna Game and Coorie Home Sustainable Home game).  

But spending money on dev time on the CO Rail Game will mean I could re-furbish the CO Rail Game with my limited coding skills in Godot to make it a Sauna Game and it could be a stretch, but also a Coorie Home game.

And with CO Rail Game, I will be introducing other routes around the world like other American States, Canada, Europe, UK, Ukraine, South America, Japan, Taiwan, China, India, and other fun ones like Christmas and maybe a Halloween/ zombie.  

Also the engine could be used for a hiking, biking, kayak/raft, XC ski, or other modes of transportation like boat, bus or hyperloop.

Anyway, the instal upfront costs could be defrayed in using the original game engine for other purposes. Which would be great and expanding in all these different areas would help further defray the costs for core features.
