I think my goals for the Data Analyst courses is just to make more templates. When people have ideas, or I have an idea, I need a way to show how those ideas, goals or projects can come together visually so everyone can see risks, goals and the end result. Stopping and thinking about projects is always a good idea. So I hope these templates can help me at work better.
