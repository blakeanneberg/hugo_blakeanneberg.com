I would do anything for a straw bale house. Yesterday I was looking at a Australian company that has prefab straw walls, and they look thinner than Modcell SIPS. 

The main thing I want is better insulation, and should prevention. 

I want to be warm/cold and not hear a thing.

I keep on thinking of two kinds of buildings... that would be fun to have in two different locations.

One kind like a giant square with a central courtyard, like a riad with a Andalusian patio or a ancient roman domus. The house would be two stories or flat with both stories flat on the grand. 

Anyway, I dream about it and would love straw walls.
