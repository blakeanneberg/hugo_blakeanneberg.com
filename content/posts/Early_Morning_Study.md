I have a new time planning idea. I wake up early and run commute to cafe, get a drink like a iced latte and a pastry like a chocolate croissant and then I fire up my computer and do a bit of CCNA study. 

This helps a couple ways. 
1. I can get a exercise done 
2. I get study in
3. I feel accomplished with learning something new
4. I get a coffee
5. I can shower at the coworking place
6. It sets me up for a great day

So I cant wait to start to do this more. I look forward to getting more work and exercise now.
