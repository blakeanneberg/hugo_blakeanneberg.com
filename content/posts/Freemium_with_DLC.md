In releasing the video game, its interesting to think about how to pay for development costs.

If the game were released as free, with core game mechanics, then it will be downloaded alot. 

Then we release paid DLC with expanded game play, its hard to know how much that DLC should cost. 

I don't often buy totally free games, and then purchase DLC. 

The model is usually paying for the game up front first, and then getting additional DLC.
