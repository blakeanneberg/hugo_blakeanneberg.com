I really liked the experience of essential oils in a Sauna in Denmark. 

Its called Saunagus and I did it at marienlyst.dk. 

I would really like to do it more often here. What I would need is

1. Approval from GH sauna.
2. Times of the day to do it, maybe Wed, Sat? 
3. Essential oils.
4. A fan. 
5. Sperilenia shots or something like that. 
6. Maybe a consultation from a Sanagus expert in Copenhagen.
7. Relaxing spa music or access to the AV system and a ringing bowl or two.
8. Maybe charge $15 with tip option
9. I do cold plunge as well 

Reasons I would like to do it:

1. Gives me a routine 
2. Income
3. Is nice

Otherwise I think I need to go to Denmark.
