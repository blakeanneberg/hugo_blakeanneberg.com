Love whole foods.

So when I end up in a whole foods, I buy a bunch of random, non food stuff. But often what I get and most look forard to, are ready made items near the bakery, salad bar and pre-made entrees and sides.

I sometimes open my Mad Fit app and look up meals for inspiration.

I then think of entrees I have not had, like spicy madras curry, and get those spacial treat meals that differ than what I normally eat. 

From bulbs, to eucalyptus spray, to chicken meals and to fruit, seeing everything there makes me love it.
