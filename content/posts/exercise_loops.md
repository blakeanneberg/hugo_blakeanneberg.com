I am re-learning loops in Python on boot.dev and it was kinda hard. But I can use Boots to help me so that was nice. 

I also often do the same loops while running. I know code and exercise are different but I am glad to be kinda boring.

I am also going to try and do the Daily Stoic 10 push-ups, 10 sit ups, 10 squats. Today at the gym I also did farmer carries and multiple rounds of different kinds of squats, sit ups and planks. 

I like loops as I don't have to think about where to go or worry about falling in unfamiliar settings. 

Also it makes not thinking about that the exercise will be hard.
