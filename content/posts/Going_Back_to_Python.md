Cant help but go back to Python as I saw a "Coding for Beginners" book in the public library. 

It seems to be pretty easy to understand.

However in my Nvim setup I didnt have a Python LSP. 

So after working on that its finally up and running... but I dont have auto complete figured out. 

Will try figuring out the config file to get that up and running. Glad to be 1/3rd into the book.
