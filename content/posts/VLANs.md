Finally getting started in learning about VLANs and how to create them.

It reminds me a bit about socal networking. I am really glad that I am studing these fundamental concepts as everything in IT rests on networking. 

I wonder if I can use the same framework to think of side projects, and how VLANs can help shape the way these projects get finished faster.
