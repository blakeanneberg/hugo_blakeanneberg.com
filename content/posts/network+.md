The Network+ course is back into my life. 

Back when I when I was answering support tickets, and getting tired of it, I started to believe there could be a different future for my career. 

I had spent years trying to learn to code on TeamTreeHouse. Weekends trying to learn to put projects together. I just was not having much success, thinking that becoming a programmer was a overnight thing. 

After becoming more demoralized, I started reach out to coworkers who I looked up to and ask them what they were learning. I discovered certifications like A+, and I soon realized I could also move into other certs like Network+. 

I felt more at home with certifications, rather than the nebulous goal of a skill like "JavaScript."

So I printed up materials from the A+ cert to learn. It soon became apparent that I was printing up a entire forest and that my actual knowledge was very small. 

It was discouraging. Especially when I was balancing a job and having a hard time finding time to study. 

Fast forward a bit of time when I thought Network+ certification was the key, I joined a apprenticeship program with network techs. However, it was hard to balance the job and hard to dedicated time to work with them. 

So now that the Network+ exam is on the radar... I am wondering if what I have learned to prep me for actually succeeding in completing this cert. 

What I do know is that I like to learn new things. I also like the confidence it gives me when I learn new things. And when I learn new things I can then say I know more, which often opens more doors for opportunities. 

So as start to re-learn Network+, perhaps it might be wise to do A+ cert first.
