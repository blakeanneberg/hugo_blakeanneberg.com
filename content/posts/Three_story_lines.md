After the video game meeting I still want to develop three eras of the game, Modern Colorado, Gold Rush Colorado and Modern Ukraine. 

But its probably bad developing three story lines at the same time as this is a huge scope. With over a hundred assets (historical stories, people stories, places to visit, things to buy) for just one story line, so that might be over 300 to 400 assets. 

I think the main push for working on three story lines at the same time is to help fund MVP 1 and MVP 2 costs. 

But it could backfire, as it could sacrifice quality. 

To fund the MVP development, people could donate or pre-purchase (or pre-order) the game. You could sell space to companies to be prominent in the game.

So ya, I still want to do story lines. It will be really nice to see progress on these there goals.
