During this holding pattern with the funding of the UXUI, I keep seeing news articles in the news about passenger rail in CO. 

I keep saving the news articles with the hope that they will be part of the story line of the game. 

I also keep thinking about the different expansions of the games, to fill out the narrative of passenger rail in other countries. I think about Shinkansen in Japan and old mining town trains in Colorado. I also think about India, China, Europe, Scotland, New Zealand, and Ukraine. 

I would love to get a bit of funding for each of these narratives, and perhaps for myself to go on them one day as research.
