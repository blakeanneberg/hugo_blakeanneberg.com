In studding the OSI model layers, I am reminded of straw bale construction and plastering in layers. I am re-learning from my notes for the Network+ exam and it appears to make more sense this second time around. I also cant wait to re-learn straw bale construction and plastering. I think this second hands on workshop will be great. 

Speaking of relearning, I am enjoying Fedora 39 on by Dell laptop using i3. In my main workspace, I have terminal running with TMUX while SSHed into my VPS, and then on the other side of the screen I have Firfox showing my learning material from TestOut while using Vimium keybindings to navigate the pages and start and stop the video. Basically I dont need my mouse, but it is sometimes helpful. In reality the mouse isn't great, and the right click button seems to push the cursor away. 

So while I have not studied as much as I would have liked today, I am adding layers to my projects and making sure they get moved forward. 

I also really liked the analogy of airplanes taking off from a airport as a metaphor for projects. Sometimes you just have to have work on a large airplane/project get up and airborne before focusing on other projects. Then once they are airborne, I can work on multiple ones.
