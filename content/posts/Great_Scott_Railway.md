In building the video game, and it getting released, it really feels like a railroad getting built. 

Large up front cost, and hopefully making money on it. 

In building future routes, I hope I can travel and do research. 

Eventually heading up to Scotland and doing a route up there. 

ScotRail names these routes, as Great Scenic Lines, but I kinda like Great Scot Lines.
