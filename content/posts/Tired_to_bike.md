I came back early to get on the trainer and bike. It was so warm out that I wanted to ride in the streets, but there are still a ton on black rocks from winter on the road and shoulder. 

So here I am writing about being too tired to bike when I should just get on the bike and do it. 

Now I am listening to Jazz. I really need to get a bike just for commuting and go around on that. 

Anyway, I need to get more use out of the trainer.
