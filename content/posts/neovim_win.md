## Looking back
When I first learned about VIM, it blew my mind that you didnt need a mouse. It took me a while to get used to VIM motions but I can still look back to that day when I felt like a real programmer. Now fast forward some years and I am learning TMUX and that seems like a like another milestone in learning programming. To be able to pickup up wher I left off on one computer and start on another is suck a game changer, let alone when I forget to sign off and my pipe gets disconnected. 
## Looking to the future
- I want to get better using my external keyboard, Kenisis 2 Advantage, and be able to 
ckly and not have cramps in my finges and hurt wrists. I now wish I had purchased a better bluetooth keyboard that you can move the keyboard paddles wider apart.
