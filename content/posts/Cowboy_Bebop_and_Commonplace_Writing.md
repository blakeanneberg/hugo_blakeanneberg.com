Listening to Shonan Beach FM, late night Jazz, which made me think of the Jazz in Cowboy Bebop as I have been thinking about Cowboys lately with the research for the Colorado Rail Game. 

While I haven't learned about ranching, cattle or individual Cowboys or the likes of Buffalo Bill, I am surrounded by books, stories and myths that drew people west. The public library has my old railroad books next to the history of Colorado as I go though all the books looking for railroad information. 

Its almost overwhelming and I am not sure how to take notes but since I learned about Commonplace books to collect alot of information and non-fiction writing and the French origin of Essays I feel like I have some solid tools.  Like today I learned ""essay" itself comes from the French word essai, meaning "attempt" or "try-out"." [via Epoch-Magizine]{https://www.epoch-magazine.com/dicarlobirthoftheessay}. 

So I am going to attempt and try out many different tools like Zotero. 

But what I really want to learn is what it was like as a passenger in one of those trains back then. So Ill revisit the library and start again on my commonplace book and system.
