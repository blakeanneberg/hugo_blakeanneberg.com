I have a old Dell laptop that I put ChromeOS Flex on. After using it for half a year, I finally thought that I needed full Linux. I use another old dell with Fedora and I3WM and I really liked that experience, but that laptop has issues with its speaker and the screen is small. 

So I finally decided to go full Linux and remove ChromeOS with Debian. However after a couple attempts with etching Debian to my USB, I gave up on Debian installer. While not thrilled with failing with Debian, I decide to go with PopOS as I knew that could have I3.  I then had to re-unlock the bios of the dell using the special code and pressing `ctl` + `enter` and  I was able to etch I3 and the computer recognised it.

So after using PopOS and their window manager, I still miss I3 as it makes me focus better when studding, but I am pretty happy with Pop even though there is a bit of a learning curve in learning their new window manager. 

Overall, I am glad I tried out Pop and I do not miss ChromeOS.
