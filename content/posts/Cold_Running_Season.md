Its dark out when I go run at 5pm. Its also cold. 

I now have to wear pants, gloves, hat, and potentially multiple layers for jacket. 

I have to watch out for ice, uneven surfaces and potentially bring lights. 

Not linking it. 

But I am looking forward to skate skiing in the dark.

What would be better is to go run in the morning. But ill have to dress up even more and wake up super early in the morning.
