A lot of what I do is learn abstractly about tech and but then in the field have to remember how to use it. 

For example, I have been learning about switches and ports, but had to remember quickly the stuff about switches to be able to re-learn how to find ports on a NVR.  

I now know how to find video feeds from the NVR after having more time to take time and get familiar with the NVR. 

But this morning I did not.

Tech skills are really two separate things. 

Tech is pretty simple, and there are hard facts. 

The skills part is not taught but rather learned though doing it in practice and potentially failing. 

I feel that I am also having a hard time with the skills part in working with python and nvim. 

I want to be able to see definitions and get code help with python... but have no idea how to do that with what I have learned with nvim. There is a disconnect. Only by failing and trying and re-trying am I going to get the skills to get it working to my needs. 

So, while today was frustrating, confusing and costly, I did finally learn how to find video feeds and ports on the NVR.
