There are alot of things to do before the game release. 

However, once its ready it will be a huge relief. 

I am so excited to learn more Godot and Python to make the game better. 

Just yesterday, I exported a practice game that I followed the tutorial in GameDevTV from Godot to Linux... and it was just so fun to see it run on Linux.

My next step is to get it playable on Steamdeck. I think its the perfect form factor for that device. Cant wait to play it some day on a Steam Frame.
