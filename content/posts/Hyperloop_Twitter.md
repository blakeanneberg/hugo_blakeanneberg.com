After not having Twitter on my phone for months, I finally logged in to see what Hyperloop groups were still active. Unsurprisingly many of the European groups were still tweeting, and much fud was being said in the #hyperloop search.

I would like to do a video again soon but I am not sure I have time.

It takes time to write a scrip and I just dont have the energy.

So I was thinking of doing the livestream of building passenger rail in Colorado in City Skylines and also speaking about hyperloop. Or I use a mod from citywokcitywalls assets on Steam Workshop.

So the crux of it is finding motivation, and then setting aside time. Its hard to keep the alignment of work not crossing the path of my goals in life as well as hobbies and exercise.

I do like envisioning a hyperloop but I do want to see it actually built, just like I want to spend more time doing things that give me meaning.
