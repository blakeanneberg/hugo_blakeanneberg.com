Post Ironman I am struck by how much free time I have.

I feel that its a good time to think about the blue sky and green fields.

Basically what do I want to fill my time with next... aka blue sky.

And how do I want to start fresh... green fields.

For blue sky:
- Video game creation.
- Cook more.
- Grow plants indoors more.
- More weights and yoga.

For green fields its pretty much all the same items above as I will be starting from pretty much a blank slate, but with some guidance:
- For video games, I have a team and a plan.
- For cooking I have a new cookbook.
- For growing plants, I have new seeds and soil and pots.
- For wights and yoga I have a workout plan (Ironman weight lifting and MadFit app) and will join in on yoga classes again.

So I am looking forward for this second 'new years' start before the fall.
