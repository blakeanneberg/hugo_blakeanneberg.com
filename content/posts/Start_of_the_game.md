I am really excited with the start of Phase 1 of the Rail Game.

I look forward to making stories, doing research and doing public outreach. 

The outreach might include video, like interviews or live streams.

Also, yesterday when I started up Civ7, it crashed. I was a bit sad. Also, I feel with these big video games like Civ7 or Helldivers, or even Cyberpunk, I feel that they are really stressful. 

I defiantly like easy, chill games with themes of history (Civ, Hogwarts Legacy) or science (Starfield) or architecture (Cities: Skylines, Tiny Glade)
