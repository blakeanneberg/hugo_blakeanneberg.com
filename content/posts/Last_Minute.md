There are a couple things I don't like doing last minute.

- Rushing a swim. I don't like swimming really fast, nor rushing to get over there and start a swim.
- Deadlines. I don't like the anxiousness of deadlines, and rushing to publish before that deadline. 
- Running. I don't like rushing a run... or running to catch a train or a bus. 
- Packing up in the morning. Not fun, and I might forget something.

Just not fun rushing things at the last minute. Usually means something needs to be looked at again.
