Its been a while since I last swam and today was nice as it snowed and all around the pool are nice pillows of snow. While swimming I was thinking about the video game and some of the goals this year have been accomplished but also where to go from here. Some of those goals are: 

The game is live, but still not ready for download... but for the first big update, I need to add more images, and start thinking about the next cities and locations to add as well as the new orange route.

For swimming, I already accomplished the longest swim on Jan 1, and now I just want to keep in shape and swim faster.

I keep thinking about Coorie Home game and Sauna game too and how I want to develop those in Scotland and Finland. 

Its just amazing to be able to swim and also swim while its cold and snowy.
