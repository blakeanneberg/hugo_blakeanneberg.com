I am taking a break from Python... for some reason its hard... and I am skipping to learn my command line.

I am glad I am getting better at `grep` and file paths like Ablsolute vs Relative. 

I think these short breaks are good but I also feel bad that I am avoiding python... as I eventually want to start GO. Also I fogot that after Python I will then start to learn Javascript...

So ya I have a long time to keep studying. 

Also, I had a horrible run today, but I enjoyed being outside and listeing to music. So I am trying to at lest do some training and some studying... even though its not the best quality and might not be helping directly with the immediate goal. 

Also I am needing to be a better writer... all these sentences are the same. At least I am just writing down these blog posts instead of not writing the blog posts.

Just getting back to getting back.
