I think about Video Games a lot. I also play alot. From Civ to City Skylines to my latest favorite, Starfield. I like thinking during the day about what I want to build or do when later in the evening I get to play.

On the flip coin, I also think about what I want to study or learn about in the evening. I signed up for even more courses last night. Mainly about business analysis and hospitality courses.

For some reason, both this ways to spend time is fun for me. In reading "The Daily Stoic", he has a hole chapter about titled "Education is Freedom," and to that I would add it is also calming. Calming in that I don't feel scared while encountering new experiences or huge projects. Education really does make you more freeier.
