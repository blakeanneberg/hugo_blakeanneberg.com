I am so glad to use Vim motions in Godot script editor. 

I was having such a painful time using mouse. Now I can work so much easier places just with keyboard. I also like Godot having a LSP, so I dont have to remember everything about the syntax.

I hope that Godot can be my first real life coding win. I never really did any Javascript or Go project, so Godot script will hopefully be my first. Also need to continue to learn Python on Boot.dev.
