I am glad I am taking so many online courses as I think it is giving me better skills that I can immididate use. 

Take for example [Firm Learning](https://www.firmlearning.com/), which is for consultants but I paid for the 'Communications and Slide Writing Academy.' This is where I learned how to write slides, or even blog posts about structuring a online for all kinds of documents. First, you outline the most important item you want to convey. Then in three sub arguments you give a summary, and in each one of those you have 3 supporting evidences. 

Watching developers/programmers talk in YouTube videos also lets me learn about the wider world of backed development, which seems like a very interesting world to me. Just like ThePrimigine talking about SQL databases, I feel like the Firm Learning structure arguments just like SQL databases. Its fun to see similarities. 

Finally, I just like learning and it makes me happy.

I use Debian BTW.
