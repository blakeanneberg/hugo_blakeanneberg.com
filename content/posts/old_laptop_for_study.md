Its a really old Dell laptop that doesnt have much RAM or Memory but Fedora with i3 works amazing. 

I have Firefox, Tmux and perhaps a calculator if I am doing subnetting on the screen. 

The speakers are not the best, the battery maybe lasts for almost 3 hours and the trackpad is just bad, but its lightweight, the keyboard feels good and the backlight keys still works. 

Overall I am super happy to have this old laptop for study as it also keeps me focused on the main task of study and getting better with Tmux, neovim, linux and i3. 

If I had a more modern laptop, I would get distracted with the better screen for youtube videos, playing steam games and using a GUI rather than i3. 

My next new computer will hopefully be a Macbook Air, but I would rather get a system76 laptop so I can still be in i3 as it really is that good for my study goals.
