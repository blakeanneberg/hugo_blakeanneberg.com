I am really looking forward for this plan that revolves around being a indi dev. 

0. Learn more Python, Godot and how to realase game on Steam, during all these stages.
1. Release CO Rail Game. 
2. Release add ons that expand on the content with locations around the world.
3. Release Sauna Game that is similar to CO Rail Game with static images and text and buttons.
4. Release Coorie Home that could be 3D modeled with Blender and use Godot. 
5. Release Door Lock App. 

I think thats about it. Looking forward to do all these things.
