Woke up really early on a Sunday by my alarm which somehow was still set from a early morning race. Luckily this was launch day and my overall impression of the launch was that I am really surprised that the Booster was caught by the chopsticks. I was also surprised that the Starship still had a bit of tile issues near the flap. 

Later in the day I re-started my learning for the CCNA with a change, from studying subnetting to using the network simulator to start learning how to interact with routers and switches. There must be over a hundred simulations and I am finally interacting with the equipment virtually that I hope to one day know how to use in real life. 

So are the two things similar? 

Well the catch on by the chopsticks almost looked like a simulation. And the interfaces that I am connecting with could as well be real life. But the launch and catch really did happen and the simulation of the interfaces are digital.

So I am really happy I had both today. I then thought what if I worked at a rocket company and did network. Well that seems really far off, but close enough to be reality.
