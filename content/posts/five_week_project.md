I have not updated the blog due to a work project that has taken now 5 weeks. 

Some of the project management lessons I have learned:

1. Scope out projects better.... espically the fundamental truthes that the projects presume.
2. Make sure you have enough people for projects. If initial people are not enough, then it will be a problem.
3. If there is a problem. Stop and get attention to the situation. 

Other things I learned personally. 

1. Working on weekend is overtime. 
2. Ask for help. 
3. Dont do all the work yourself and give projects/tasks to other departments.  

I keep thinking about the triple constraint of project management.
