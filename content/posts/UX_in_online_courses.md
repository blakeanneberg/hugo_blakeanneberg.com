I am in Coursera most of the time for online courses and I have a few recommendations on how they could make finishing courses better for users like me.

*   Make a dark mode. None of the website can be toggled to eye friendly dark mode and this is a huge as we are putting a ton of screentime into watching their videos and takeing exams in front of white sreen that is painful.
*   Improve the iPad app. It is impossible to view all the courses I am enrolled in on the iPad. There is a bug where it just shows lines where the courses are and you have to scroll to the bottom and then scroll back to the top to make the courses show up.
*   Courses are a mess. You have to click around alot to get into and out of units and modules.
*   Embed a text to speech engin! Yes the AI help bot is great but stop delaying a TTS AI bot to help!
*   Note taking app. Having a embeded note taking app within the website would be awesome.
*   Follow what Khan Academy is doing and make it more playful.
*   I also wish my portfolio submissions could also be viewed just as my Certificates are viewable.

These are some of my gripes but I love taking courses on Coursera (its better than edX with the breath of subjects) but some of the above UX changes would be a huge help.
