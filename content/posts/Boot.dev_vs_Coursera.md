When I think about online study I often think of Coursera, However, I now thint its a bit too passive. I need to be using what I learn.

So I looked at my Coursera courses and didn't see anything except a TCPIP course. I wanted to do something a bit different tonight so I logged back into my Boot.Dev course and click start over on Python. 

For right now I want interactive and practical.
