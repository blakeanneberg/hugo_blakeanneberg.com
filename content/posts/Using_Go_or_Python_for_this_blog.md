I have been wanting to use what I am learning to make this blog better. I was thinking I would use Python from my boot.dev course and then learn Django. However, I am now leaning to Hugo and take a risk as I do not know Go.

I am still trying to figure out a way to learn and make time during the day to do online courses and projects/tasks like upgrade this blog. In that regard I am either going to need to re prioritize work and life, or do code stuff early in the morning as I like to work out at night.

Another thing I want to do is get a Dell XPS 13" laptop and put Debian on it. I have found that using old laptops with ChromeOS or Fedora are okay but not a fun way to work. Also my Surface Pro digs into my lap with its kickstand and has Windows. So I would like to start fresh.

Finally, I think I have decided to use Hugo, with Netlify and Github. Then in the future I can create my own template and also eventually use Django for a website or web app. So I am very much looking forward to that.
