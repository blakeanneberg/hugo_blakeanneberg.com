The timezone changed with fall back and its getting dark. I dont know if I am really ready for winter. 

I did probably the last warm long run here till next spring. This run was hard, I went really snowly, running though the golf course and up the pass a bit. The cold weather helped and my having hyderation with mix made me feel great. 

I also cant wait for working on some projects next year. Like ironman race, the video game, and perhaps more straw bale.
