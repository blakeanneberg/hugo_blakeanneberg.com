I watched a YouTube about how to plat trees for growing a forest. there were two methods. The regular approach is to just plant a some trees without much thought. The second thought is to use a method called the Miyawaki method.

This is to first improve the soil if needed. Then plant native trees and plants and as many different ones as possibly, and as closely together so there is more competition between the young trees. For some reason this also spurs protection between the plants and things go much faster than normal plants. 

Anyway, I also learned about combating heat island effects in cities by planting more trees and having water features and covered spaces. I hope we can do this more in places like shopping districts and parking lots. 

As I was biking this weekend I really liked biking under trees. It not only was cooler but also soothing as something like a tree takes years to grow, and thus feels and gives a sense of permanence. 

As I look out out a  mountains and see pine trees I also see a Aspen tree and I love how it moves in the wind, shimmering and making a great sound with its leaves. 

I wish I could learn more about trees. 

Another thing I was thinking about is the train game. I rented some books from the library about Trains in Colorado and found info about making pixel art and found another person that made a pixel art train game. So I am glad I found that online as  it will motivate me to continue work.
