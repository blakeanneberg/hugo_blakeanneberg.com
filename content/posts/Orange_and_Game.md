Its been a while since the last post. Been busy with Ironman training and video game Travel by Train. 

But after going to an opening of a brand new building as a artist in resident house, it really was cool to think of some of the connections to this new house. 

Its one big room. Has a very large door window. Mettle cladding roof and shell. All white inside. 

It looks very prefabricated, and I wish it straw bale house

It reminds me of wanting to see the original structurally insulated panel straw bale house and what I want from my own straw bale house. 

The opening of the event was really nice as I met alot of artists, and benefactors of arts. I told them about my video game and made a new connection to a local library.

I really cant wait to build a straw bale video game.

The air is really orange today with wildfire smoke. Its hazy. I want to take the gondola up tomorrow and maybe run down and see what it looks like from the top of the mountain.
