Its been a while since the last post. Basically been working on Ironman training and video game Travel by Train. 

But after going to an art event opening of a artist in resident house, it really was cool to think of some of the connections to this new house. 

The house its built like this:

Its one big room. Has a very large door window. Mettle cladding roof and shell. All white inside. 

Alot of this is what I like about straw bale housess  and what I want from my own straw bale house. 

Next, I was surrounded by alot of artists, which was really cool. I told them about my video game and made a new connection to a local library.

The air is really ornage today with wildfire smoke. ITs hazy. I want to take the gondola up tomorrow and maybe run down and see what it looks like from the top of the mountain.
