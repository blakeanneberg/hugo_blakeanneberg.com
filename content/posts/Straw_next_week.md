I am really looking forward to a straw bale work camp next week where 30 or so volunteers will help fill in the insulation of between the frames with straw. 

I am just so happy that I signed up for this so long ago.

I think I am more happy in that I am doing things I want to do and going after dreams and things that I want to go after. 

I know it will be hot, construction is dangerous, and I will be car camping, but I will be doing the thing that I have talked and dreamt about so much.

So I only have some regrets before the workcamp. 

1. I didn't do any YouTube stuff in promoting straw bale or Coorie Scottish.  
2. I have not signed up for more straw bale workshops. 
3. I am not getting experience with modular construction. 

Otherwise, I will have made it and life is pretty much just showing up. 

I am looking forward to learning and making new friends, thinking about buying land, learning more trades, and advancing my goals for Coorie home. 

So I am super stoked for next week. :-)
