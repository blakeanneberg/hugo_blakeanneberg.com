The two game ideas I had are:

- Give train cars different names and themes.
- Really customize the view out of the train car to the location its passing.

I like connecting local environment of animals like the rabbit I saw and the anvil cloud that was in the distance to something that might make the game feel more localized to the land its in. 

Cant wait to actually learn how to code and git it in the game.
