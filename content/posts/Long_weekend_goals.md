With Labor day coming up, I have a big backlog of things to work on. 

1. Work on game. Specifically hand over the UX workflow to the dev team.
2. Learn more CCNA. Get Packet Tracer app up and play around.
3. Learn more Go.
4. Do a bit of Tableau.
5. Do YouTube video of Straw Bale House project.
6. Do YouTube video of game development. 

Also I want to do some other things.
- Plan Trip to Finland/Estonia
- See if I should register for Ironman Copenhagen 
- Do lots of running.
- Go biking. 
- Swim and use steam room.

Finally I want to play a bit more of Starfield and perhaps Harry Potter on my Steam Deck.
