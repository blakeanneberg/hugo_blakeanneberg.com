I finally have enough old equipment to start a homelab. Some of it includes

- Old WAPs
- Network switches
- Cloudcore router 
- Firewall
- Fiber and SFPs 
- Old micro desktops
- Possible old working server

What I have for plans is to create this homelab and then somehow set up a way to remotely log into it. But I really have no idea how to do this right now. 

Also I don't know where it should be placed... and where a good spot would be for it to live. 

The main goal for the is to study for the CCNA and pass it. 

Otherwise the second goal is to just get better familiarization on how servers work and how to create my own network and break things. I also like the idea of remote access and being able to learn how to connect to multiple things. 

I plan on breaking alot of things and I am glad this equipment is old as well as free.
