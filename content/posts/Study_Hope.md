After my hour of study Network+ I am starting to feel a bit confident. 

I think I might be able to study it all and pass the exam.

I do want to go back and take exact steps and notes for subnetting. As well as do more with TCPIP and OSI model.

If I can get those down and memorized I will have a huge shot of actually passing. 

I am looking forward to not having to study for this exam, and being more confident in general networking. 

Otherwise, I think this one hour of study each day is almost like the marathon training. Just commit an hour and half to running and you can train for a marathon... or at least get a good base. Same with studying for the network exam.
