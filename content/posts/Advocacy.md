Really happy when plans come together. Its been many months since we first started to scope out the Colorado Rail game. 

Today was the first meeting with the project manager who is helping guide the project. What struck me was how much research he did to understand the game. From comparing the game to others, to figuring out what the color scheme is, to asking who the target audience is to understanding the flow of the game and the attractions. It was the perfect PM.

I also need to focus advocacy into the game. Its exciting to think of what will happen in the game, but at the end of the day there needs to be a call to action. So I am excited to start thinking this how this game educate and hopefully start more advocacy for trains in Colorado.
