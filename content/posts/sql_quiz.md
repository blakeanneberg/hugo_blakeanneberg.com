While taking my online course SQL for Data Sciene on Coursera, I reallt under estimated that the exams would be quite long with alot of queries. It was pretty painful to get my head thinking about how to write them and I was getting pretty impatient. 
However, writing these queries is getting me excited when I eventually learn how to write in Go and be able to connect my app with the database. 

Anither thing I cant wait to do is to learn how to write HTMX.Eventually i want to write Go and HTMX and SQLite for all the things.
