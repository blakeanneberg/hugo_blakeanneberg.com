While taking my online course SQL for Data Science on Coursera, I really under estimated that the exams would be quite long with alot of queries. It was pretty painful to get my head thinking about how to write them and I was getting pretty impatient. 

However, writing these queries is getting me excited when I eventually learn how to write in Go and be able to connect my app with the database. 

Another thing I cant wait to do is to learn how to write HTMX.Eventually i want to write Go and HTMX and SQLite for all the things.

Finally, when I sat down to finally study SQL, I went down a rabbit hole and watched videos from the Primagine and wanted to re-learn how to draw ASCII art with a tool called Boxes.

| "Pursue making how you feel  |
| align with reality           |
| as opposed to                |
| letting reality              |
| be aligned to how you feel." |

So, after trying to get the above quote put into a box, I didnt understnad the instructions, i finally figured it out. 

1. Install the app boxes on your linux computer
2. open vim or neovim
3. write out your text or quote. 
4. hit `esc`
5. in command mode write the line number example is line 10 where the quote starts: `12!!boxes -d stone` or if you have multiple lines, visually select with `v` and then `:!!boxes -d stone`
6. press enter to get it to print the box out.
