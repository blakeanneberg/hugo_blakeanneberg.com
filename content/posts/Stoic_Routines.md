This is a foundation of of stoic thought. Some of mine are:

- Exercise every day
- Learn a bit of code (boot.dev python, Go, CCNA)
- Work on the video game or learn Godot or pixel art or Blender
- Try and wake up early
- Writing out helps put distance to see a new perspective. 

Basically its structure and systems to make me productive.

But also I don't get upset as I have to be flexible if I don't have enough time for the routine.
