I just found out that computer calculator in Fedora "gnome_calculator" can do exponents by holding down the `Ctrl` key and typing out the exponent you want. 

This was an amazing breakthough for me and why I am glad I decided to study at 11pm at night.

Also I am glad to have gone on a difficult run, one that I really wanted to push, and that I saw alot of animals, alot of golden aspen and alot of sunset. I also ran in the dark on the way down which was a very new experience.
