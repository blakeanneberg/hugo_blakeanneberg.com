So at first I was thinking of writing about CCNA and how I run loops around a park.

Yet, it also turns out I was writing about chaperters in life and how I am learning programming languages like python and Go wich will have loops. 

So while I work though the chapters in the CCNA textbooks, I cant help to think how long its taken for me to get to this  point.

I am learning programming languages for like the 13th year going too. 

So its just taking me a long time, and feels like I am in a loop of learning, which is okay.
