At first I was thinking of writing about the CCNA textbooks which I am slowly getting though and how I run loops (slowly) around a park.

For the CCNA textbooks, I cant help to think how long its taken for me to get to this point.

I have been on Github for 13 years, which I made sure by doing math in the command line: `expr 2024 - 2011` 

So its just taking me a long time, and feels like I am in a loop of learning and runnnig. This is kinda ironic as Python and Go have loops.
