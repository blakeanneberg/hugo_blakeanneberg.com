I have not been studying and I have not been working on any project as I have been focusing on pretty much work and running.

I feel like I am cramming for a test in getting ready for the marathons. I wish I had started running a bit earlier this year and traing like in the last blog post with incrimental daily runs.

Otherwise I feel like I am pretty fit and will just survive marathons at lower altitude. 

On the other front of study and projects I have alot of regret that I have not followed thought with Coorie Home video content and also have not made time for the train video game.

Mainly I have been busy at work. A number of things happended early last week and that prevented me from doing anything. 

Finally, I am just so glad about spring. I read that in Sweden the changes to spring and summer make a major transition of people slowing down life and being more in nature. I think I have started to do this in the last couple days. I even ran and swam and sat outside alot this weekend. 

I am just glad that I can do things outsisde. Some things I want to do more this summer are:

- Garden and see things grow and perhaps eat them.
- Hit golf balls
- Play tennis and pickle ball
- Swim more
- Run more
- Bike out to Fika in Parker (both stores)
- Sleep outside perhaps. 

So there is a lot and I cant wait to have a change.

Also I want to do more things that are in my Jira tasks and complete some of the online courses.
