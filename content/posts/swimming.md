The blog post title was going to be exercise but I want to talk more about swimming in particular. I want to talk about being in the pool for a couple of reasons.

*   Swimming gives you gains. It makes you really buff without having to lift weights.
*   Its basially like yoga and afterwards I think it makes you feel just as relaxed.
*   The pool is very rairly busy, so its super easy to get in and do the 1500 meters and then get out.

I am just so glad I learned how to swim and think I will continue to do it for a very long time.
