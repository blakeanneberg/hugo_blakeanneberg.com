I am so glad I am having some success with online study. 

Getting test problems correct is really nice for a change.

I made a ton of mistakes, but that is okay.

Again, I am so glad I have switched to CCNA from Network+. Things are just clicking alot better.

But I am wanting to go back to boot.dev and continue my coding leaerning. 

Just glad to have some happiness with my studies.
