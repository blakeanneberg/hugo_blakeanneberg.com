Some goals for 2024 from the top of my mind:

1.  Run more, or even every day, including more marathons
2.  Learn bagpipes
3.  Finish more of my certificates
4.  Continue to get better at Neovim and submit to Github almost every day
5.  Travel more and do projects when I travel like straw bale projectes
6.  Cook more
7.  Wear more sunscreen

Who knows how these goals will go over time but i feel like my goals in life are becoming more focused and are more fun to accomplish.

Basically the goal for 2024 is to do things that I would like to do.
