Today I didn't feel motivated to get my laptop opened at 10:40 at night and try and learn some python. I had a long day and it was frustrating troubleshooting.

So I started the module on debugging. 

But what I learned is that I can use the same logic in debugging with larger tech issues at work. The basic method is:

Attempted to solve it yourself first
Use print() statements to understand what your code is actually doing
Test different approaches
Identify the specific part that's confusing you

Whats even more remarkable is that its an AI that I am having help me learn debugging.
