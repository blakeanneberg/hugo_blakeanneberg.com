Well, I have two big things coming up which will take alot of time.

1. Colorado Rail Game
2. Network+

Both are huge goals and after reviewing all my ideas for the Rail Game and re-visiting the TestOut coursework for Network+ I feel like I am prepaired to tackle them. 

For the game, there is so much that I can draw upon from recent events and historical events, that I feel like the story will come together pretty easily. I just need to sit down and focus on the task. 

For the Network+ I feel like I have learned alot, and that I just need to sit down and focus on the task. 

However, all the other courses might need to take a step back for a bit. Also my other goals of Coorie Home, Denmark, gardening, marathons, YouTube, and relaxing will need to be delayed till like July. 

I still can plan on doing the workshops in July and later summer though. It might be a great thing to look forward to. 

I just need to make this a gamification on how to get the Rail Game and Network+ done as fast as possible. 

I also want to figure out how to use `g` in Vim motions. 

So many goals for the next couple months, I feel like they are all heading in the correct direction.
