I really like to travel, and I also like to play video games that make it so I can travel without leaving my current location.

Civilization, Starfield and even City Skylines are games that make me think I cam traveling around.

I also like cooking up dishes that I ate when I traveled. 

This includes food from India, Japan and Scotland.

I am so glad to be making a video game that makes it so you can travel virtually and also be able learn about food from other cultures. 

Combining this in game is really nice as I can share with others interesting locations, food, history and culture that I too like to seek out in video games.
