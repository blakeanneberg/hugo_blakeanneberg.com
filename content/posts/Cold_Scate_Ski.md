The snow has been so bad that finally there was 3 inches that fell and I went out to the Nordic Center. 

First, it was really cold, with wind, so maybe it was in the single digits, but around 13 on my car. 

Second, the snow blew away from the exposed areas of the trail, which were hard to see.

Third, I just had waxed them and now there are some areas where rocks and pebbles which tore up my new wax and make alot of rips into the actual skis.

So it was frusterating but I am glad I did it. I am also glad I did not buy new skis this year as I think this will be a short season.
