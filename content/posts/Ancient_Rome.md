Where does one start. 

Rome is so old, that you literally have to go down layers of dirt and dust in order to find it. 

There are many things that makes me interested in Rome, but what really surprises me is that I just was there. I never thought I would visit again. Some things that make me interested in Rome.

- I really like ancient Roman houses with a center courtyard with water. This helps cool the house and I feel like it would make the home feel cozy with life focusing on the rooms that overlook the fountain. 
- I like Latin and Roman history. 
- I like ancient Roman armor. 
- I like the layouts of Roman cities. 
- I like stoic thought. 
- I like to imagine Rome spanning from Scotland to Turkey.

Those are just some of the reasons why I like ancient Rome.
