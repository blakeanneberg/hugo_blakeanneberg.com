Sustanable in the sence that I can pay to create and maintain them. The video game business plans I am working on.

1. Create game, crowdfund.
2. Have content expansions, paid or donate? 
3. Merch store, paid. 

The second meaning of "Sustainability" is that the game is focused on building a straw bale house and using renewable resources and construction materials sustainability. 

It would be like learning about sustainable construction techniques and then plopping down assets on a 2Dmap to build a house. It would be chill and relaxing game that would be educational. It would perhaps use Godot game engine to build it. 

Need to finish the first game first before getting exacted about the second game.
