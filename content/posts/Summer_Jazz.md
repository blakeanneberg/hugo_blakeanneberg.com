Listening to Shonan Beach FM and wishing I could take a flight to Tokyo and spend the summer on the beach learning how to surf. 

Other things I could do there:

- Work on the video game
- Learn japanese cooking
- Learn gardening
- Go bike riding
- Work in a coffee shop
- Learn how to sail
- Learn Japanese

Anyway, I am ready to endure the hot summer with Jazz.
