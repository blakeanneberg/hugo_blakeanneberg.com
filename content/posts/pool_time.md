It has been a while since I last swam. Some things that I realized:
- It was cold outside and when I first got in, but was manageable by the end.
- I need a swim cap. 
- Not swimming means you loose it pretty quickly.
- I am going to try and not use fins.
- I am going to try and do pushups on the deck.
- I need jammers.
- I need more lotion and swim shampoo for after the swim.
- Its really interesting to see stars above me from under the water.
- There was alot of fog rolling off the pool.
- I think I also want ear protectors so water doesnt get in my ears.
- I need to eat food before so I am not hungry in the water.
- I really like my pool locker so I dont have to trave with my swim stuff.

Those are just some of things I think when I go swim.
