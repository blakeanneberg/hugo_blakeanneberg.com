Glad that I can take a bus pretty much any time to and from the mountains.

There is something like 20 buses going to Union Station. Which is great as none are usually totally full. 

Otherwise would love if there as 20 passenger trains going to and from,so we wouldn't have to rely on the highway being closed.
