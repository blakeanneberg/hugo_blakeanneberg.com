Funny to have two days off of study and exorcizes.

By the third day I am itching to study and go for a run/swim/bike.

I am now catching up and doing a bit of study before going to bed. 

I feel a bit rusty in starting up finding numbers of subnets and I wish I had gone for a long swim this weekend.  

Also if I were to list my hobbies I guess it would be:

- Straw bale house
- Video game
- Exercising

I cant wait to do more with all these hobbies in the future.
