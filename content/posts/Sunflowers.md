Out of all the seeds that are planted I feel like sunflowers are some of the easist to grow.

I really like the many different kinds of sunflowers.

Sunflowers mean many differnet things:
- Bright hopefull flowers that follow the sun
- Utility of the seeds and polination for bees
- Fast growth and strong stocks. 
- Large leaves soaking up energy. 
- Multiple flowers on each stock.
