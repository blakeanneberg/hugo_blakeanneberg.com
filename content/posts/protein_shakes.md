After I am done at work I go do a workout or do some study. 

I am usually pretty hungry as it could be around 4-6 pm when I do this. 

So I have enjoyed drinking a 325 ML dark chocolate protien shae with 20g protein. It fills me up and makes me study better.

Also cheap at less than $5.00 and healthier than other sports drinks.

Would recommend with a apple or banana or beef jerky.
