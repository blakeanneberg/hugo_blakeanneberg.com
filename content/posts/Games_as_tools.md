While running on the treadmill I was reading the book "Playing with reality" by Kelly Clancy. It goes though the history of games, and the related fields that games effect.

But the main thing that I get out of the book is this: 

Games can change history. The Rail Game goal is to make passenger trains in Colorado popular and empower everyone to push for transportation. I can't wait to also share cool info about local history in regards to trains. 

Otherwise, I hope its fun play.
