I read on the treadmill. Couple factors play into this. 

The treadmill faces a wall and has no TV.

I have the Libby app and public libary access.

My phone can display the text big enough to read while jogging slowly. 

Its nice as I usually start falling asleep and getting a run and read in is good use of time.
