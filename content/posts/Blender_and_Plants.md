Blender, the 3d modeling software and plants have something in common. 

Well seeds of plants. 

I want to be able to make things in Blender and use them as assets in games. I also have seeds for plants, and I want to be inspired to make little 3d terrariums.  

I also want to do a couple things daily.

1. Make time for exercise every day.
2. Do couple lessons of Boot.Dev, Godot on GameDev.TV 
3. Do couple lessons art/drawing course also from GameDev.TV 
4. Do more creative writing or video.

I look forward to using my drawing tablet as well.
