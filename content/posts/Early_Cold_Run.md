I missed my workout yesterday, so unfortunately the workouts build up. 

I was supposed to run 5 miles yesterday and then run 7 miles fast today.

So I just did the 5 miles, and it was around 27F. It was cold the whole way around while wearing shorts, singlet and jacket with hoodie. 

I am really happy I did the run even though I was slow and I had to do loops to avoid construction. 

I think it goes back to the being Stoic and having a routine. Just keep doing the routine.
