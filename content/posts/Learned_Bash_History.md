I finally learned how to write out a particular line in history.

I can never remember the IP address  o log into a VPS via SSH. So I have to rely on typing `history` and then finding where I had last typed it and then copy and pasting the input into the new bash line. 

This all is a pain. So I finally googled `get out of input mode and go to end of line in vim` and found a forum post where the person said `CMD` + `R`. 

This is such a revelation and is exactly why I love learning terminal, bash and Vim.
