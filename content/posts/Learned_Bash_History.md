I finally learned how to write out a particular line in history.

I can never remember the IP address  o log into a VPS via SSH. So I have to rely on typing `history` and then finding where I had last typed it and then copy and pasting the input into the new bash line. 

This all is a pain. So I finally Googled something like `search bash history and select input` and found a forum post where the person said `CMD` + `R`. 

This is such a revelation and is exactly why I love learning terminal, bash and Vim. 

Next I am learning to customize TMUX and further imrpove my knowldege of I3 window manager.
