It seems like Colorado's history of trains is also about the geology and rocks of Colorado.  

The mountains are so tall, the valleys are so narrow, and the rocks are so hard. 

Its hard to fathom just how much effort it was moving all the rocks, but with modern earth moving methods, and large amounts of money and energy the old pioneers had conquered the mountains. 

Even driving though i70 is crazy. Its hard to imagine how wit was before. 

The experiences of those forgotten times, and those routes that are hard to make out before weather or development erases those monuments and  efforts, is something that would be fun to explore and record. I know there are alot of interesting stories, but I also want to press that there is a future where we can be where we have better ways of getting our the state again.
