I have had this old laptop for three years and I like using fedora on it with i3. 

However in i3, I am really not liking dmenu.

I cant find chrome as its like downloaded though gnome or something. So the other day I learned about Rofi from a Arch ricing YouTube video.

I saw that it did exactly what gnome did in like PopOS!. 

So I installed it but now I need to figure out how to make it the main application manager and retire dmenu forever.
