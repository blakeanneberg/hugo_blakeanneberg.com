I like clubs as they promote growth, community and meeting new people:
- University affiliated clubs
- Exercise/workout clubs
- Air and space clubs
- Computer clubs
- Outdoor clubs
- Cold plunge clubs
- Language clubs
- Scandinavian culture clubs
- Writing clubs
- Alumni clubs
- Running clubs
- Supper clubs

So its weird that I work for a night club.
