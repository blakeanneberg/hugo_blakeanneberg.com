Recently I have seen alot of positive updates regarding hyperloops and trains. 

Specifically, hyperloop test track updates in Europe and Colorado and passenger rail plans in Colorado.

For hyperloop, Hardt Hyperloop and the European Hyperloop Center are completing their test track. I would love to see this in person. Also Swiss Pod is starting their test track in Pueblo Colorado at the PuebloPlex train testing facility. I too would love to visit this and support this. 

Next, passenger rail in Colorado is at the forefront for planning after so long. This has the opportunity to have train service along the entire Front Range and go into other states. 

Truly we are at a milestone for these two modes of transportation. I just hope we can get them both built soon. 

It must be a sign that I have seen these in the news and I look forward to re-starting InTheHyperloop and Colorado Hyperloop as well as give more details about a game that teaches advocacy for a Front Range passenger rail.
