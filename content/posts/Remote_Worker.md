I was thinking of being a remote worker... for my self. 

The Steam Fest deadline is fast approaching and I think only the store page has to be published for me to put my application in for Jan 5th. 

I have so many ideas using the game engine that I am looking forward to implementing them... but I am also thinking of making more time for doing the development work. So I am looking forward to being a remote self-worker some day. 

I also have enjoyed doing more Boot.Dev study. Need to do more Godot study.

And what I really need to do to is create a branch of the current game build and then the branch will be a test for the animal or hiking or biking game build. 

Or going to a country like Italy and spending a couple months doing research. But first need to complete the current train centric game.
