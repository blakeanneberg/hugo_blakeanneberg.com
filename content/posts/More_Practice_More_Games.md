I need to get back in the habit of Godot study.

There are a couple reasons I dropped off...

1. Focusing more on Boot.dev which is Python study right now. I want to keep my streak alive for January, and I am using Boots alot to help... but I feel like I am learning too. 
2. I want to run more. I want to make time to exercise as a highest priority of the entire day.

But I have a great idea on how to get more practice... and also get more games out.

I make more mini games. If I follow the Godot tutorials more on GameDevTV... then Ill have maybe 4 or 5 games to show. I want to augment those games and make them applicable to CRG.

But also today I had an epiphany. I want to make a historical game that focuses on the local area, but also ski history. The mini games from the tutorials will make learning more fun and be a package of all the projects. 

I also want to do more pixel art learning, as I think the pixel art will be a great medium for these games and the general art and aesthetic of the total package.
