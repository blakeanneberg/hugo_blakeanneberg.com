I am enjoying my new Networking course from Cisco Skills for All. Its free and I think its good so far.

I was taking notes when I wanted to make ASCII art box around the tile and I knew I made a blog post about it... So I looked up the blog post and re-read my instructions but I saw `!!` instead of `!`. So I needed to edit the `.md` blog post. But I didn't know the name of the post to find it.

So I Googled: `find the file that has a word in it in command line`

And then I found: `grep "hello" *` 

This was perfect, so I typed out `grep "ascii" *` and immediately found the file name out of all the other files in the blog post folder. It was probably the first time I have every been in deed of `grep`.

So I am glad I Am learning Networking from another online platform. So glad I am using TestOut for the more hands on learning but Cisco's Skills For All platform for easy to understand instruction.
