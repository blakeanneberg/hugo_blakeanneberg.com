I really like hot or cold green, jasmine pearl, black, or chai tea. 

I also like smoothies which have frozen blueberries, bananas, strawberries. 

Typically I like smoothies after I work out. Tea is nice in the morning up to mid day. 

Loose leaf tea is also nice, and I would like to do this more often as I feel that tea bags have less quality tea or have plastic. 

Its hard to believe how much work it is to make tea, and how to hard it is to learn how tea ceremonies are performed. 

I think having a smoothie bar would be nice and I also like wheatgrass shots after sauna.
