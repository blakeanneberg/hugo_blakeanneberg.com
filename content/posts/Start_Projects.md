I am really looking forward to starting new projects/hobbies. 

1. Using Godot and Python knowledge to start work on a game that uses the Game engine for CRG to then create a new game that centes around either hiking or biking and another game that focues on sustainable construction. I am also learing pixel art and want to develop this game with Youtube Vlogs.
2. Learn bagpipes, hopefully with a digital chanter.
3. Ardueno... 

Now just need to carve out time to work on it.
