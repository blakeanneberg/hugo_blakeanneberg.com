Cant believe were already past Halloween and onto Thanksgiving.

I am not looking forward to the rest of cold and frigid winter. 

The main thing I don't like about winter is waiting for my car to defrost. Taking precious time to scrape it and then crank up the heat by using up gas and battery life. 

I also don't like slipping everywhere. 

If I could, I would love to celebrate all these "winter" holidays and feasts some place a bit warmer.
