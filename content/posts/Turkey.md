I got a frozen turkey today.

It was free, and I am really glad to get it. 

I cant beleive were already past halloween and onto thanksgiving. 

I am also looking forward for Christmass. 

But I am not looking forward to the rest of cold and frigid winter. 

The main thing I dont like abuot winter is waiting for my car to defrost. Taking pricious time to scrape it and then crank up the heat by using up gas and battery life. 

I also dont like slipping everywhere. 

If I could I would love to celebrate all these "winter" holidays and feasts some place a bit warmer.
