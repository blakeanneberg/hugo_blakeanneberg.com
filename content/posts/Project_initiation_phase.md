While swimming I thought about three things:

1. Rail game 
2. Triathlon plan
3. Swimming

## Rail game 

I have to re-plan the project due to cost. 

There will be a discovery phase and then a development phase. The discovery phase will cost as much as I thought the whole project would cost. Then I have no idea on the development phase. 

I can pay for the discovery phase, which will then give me enough content to then go live with crowdfunding, YouTube and merch. Hopefully at the end of discovery, we will then have a better idea how much it will cost for the development phase. 

This will help then get a base of fans for the game and help perhaps with grants and partnerships. 

Another interesting thing in considering all of this, opening up for crowdfunding could also focus the game from being focused on just one geography to other parts around the world. Start with local modern day, then local historical, and then perhaps another region on earth. 


## Triathlon plan

Either I buy a training plan or reach out to old contacts for help. I think Ill reach out to old contacts as I want to structure my life around a plan sooner than later to get fit for the marathons and full tri. 

## Swimming

It was really nice to go swim and do push-ups. I haven't done both in a very long time and miss the benefits. I do want to get new goggles and perhaps new hand paddles as both are getting worn out and it would be nice to start fresh for the winter.
