Nice to have a routine of doing 1500 yards in the pool and then use the steam room for  a bit. 

While swimming I was thinking of doing push-ups, 25 per 50 yards, and then up to 100. But I decided to do some laps with head out of water in a lifeguard style swim that so you can spot the person needing help.

I really want to have a training plan though as I have kinda plateaued with ideas.

I am looking forward to perhaps one day have a coach and train for  multi sport without thinking where I am going to and what should I do from day to day.

Lets just hope the steam room works over winter so I can keep warm.
