Learning data vis in Tableau right now. I wish I had learned this earlier in my work as I think I could have used it.

I still keep thinking of my goal to make some kind of website or game where you can see hyperloop pods going around their tracks. When I am learning Tableau I am using data from the Global Hyperloop Challenge where I pitched 'Colorado Hyperloop.'

After my support of something very futuristic, I am wanting to create merch and bumper stickers that promote a Front Range Passenger Rail in Colorado. Perhaps learning how to visualize data will let me figure out cleaver ways to advocate for the train.

The goal for the next year is to create a merch store. Some of my favorite things were a poster of all the routes, a bumper sticker with the word "hyperloop", and t-Shirt that had the same "Hyperlop" and a Global Challenge T-shirt.
