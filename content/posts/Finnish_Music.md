I am really liking listing to music from Finland. Its pretty much all YLE Radio Suomi. 

I wish I was there listening to it in the car or on a train. 

I really hope I can create a rail game in finland and spend more time there experiencing Finland culture. 

Then at the same time I can make the sauna game, run marathons, and swim in lakes.
