I just learned that I Can use `return` for many things, not just simple variables. I can do calculations, and boolean, function calls, and complex combinations. 

I am glad to slowly going back into the Python course. 

Taking it a bit slowly to fully learn everything. Also wanting to use what I learn in a actual small program. So that is different.

Only goal is just do a bit every day and ask the boot.dev AI 'Boots' lots of questions.
