I think having a part time job would be best way to make time for learning and side projects. I have never had a part time job, so that will be weird. Finding motivation right now is kinda hard with a fill like job that has FTO as i cant control things breaking or projects.

I was thinking of barista but i wouldn't mind having a outdoor job working with plants or some kind sustainable construction job. Also have been thinking of Europe and where to get a job and live and to be honest, i think Colorado has just as much as those other places except a ocean.
