Thinking of what I will do over vacation time and when not running and traveling. Some things:
- online studies. 
- the game. 
- YouTube 

Some things that are not so work related are:
- Pools and swim more
- Yoga classes
- Fitness classes
- Bike ride in Copenhagen 
- Go to a cooking class

Otherwise, it will be busy. 

Also, I am looking forward to just working on things that I want to work on and getting Jira items out of the way. 

- Planning the summer
- Planning next marathons
- Enjoying stuff.
