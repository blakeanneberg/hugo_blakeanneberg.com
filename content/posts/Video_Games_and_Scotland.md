I have really enjoyed playing one video game on the steam deck... and its Hogwarts Legacy. 

Not only is it fun to run around the world of Harry Potter, and be filled with nostalgia, but also it reminds me of Scotland and Edinburgh. 

When I lived there it was so cold at night and dark... but there were bits of it being brilliant. 

Some things I miss are pubs, running around the city and how cozy things were. 

So when I play this video game... it might feel like a waste of time... it brings me back to Uni and much younger when I read Harry Potter late into the evening.
