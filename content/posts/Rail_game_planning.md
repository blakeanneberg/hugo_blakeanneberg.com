Done with phase one meaning we go onto phase two. 

Turns out its not that simple. 

Phase two is actually MVP0, MVP1 and MVP2. 

MVP0 is wrap up tasks from Phase one and set stage better for the next stages:
- Finalize wire frames. 
- Get initial play testing completed.
- Plan out narritive for crowdfunding, then launch crowdfunding, launch merch store. 

MVP1 is using funds to get a very very core game loop running with code. 
- Start creating the content/assetts to finish MVP1 and start on MVP2. 
- Light crowdfunding, plan out reaching out to grants and businesss. and launch merch store.

MVP2 will be additional conntent and citites to MVP2. 
- Heavy emphasis on crowdfunding, plug merch store.

What will be really important is to track progress, and after each meeting write down meeting notes.

Also imporant is to figure out how the game will become self suficient in its development.
