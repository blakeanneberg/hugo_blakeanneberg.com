In making a game its good to have a active PM. She thought I would benefit from having a UX expert help in the discussion to give me action items:

- make a strait forward scenario that shows the game mechanic. Whether that is in sketches, frames, power points. 
- describe in more detail the mini game.
- share free resources where to get images so we can create art. 

So now I have alot of homework to do, but I feel good as I understand the direction better.
