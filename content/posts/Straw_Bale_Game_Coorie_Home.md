I have been thinking alout about this future project.

Yesterday I watched a video by Indi Game Clinic who was talking about Game Loops. And he basically said for solo/indi game devs not to worry about game loops and rather focus on the treasure chests. These treasure chests are the individual components that make your game fun... and once you have enough of them, you can combine them into a game loop. 

So I have been thinking about tresure chests, and some of these features might be:

- Put different kinds of heat souces into the home, in-floor radiant heat, Finnish soapstone fireplace, geothermal, mini split, heat pumps etcs.
- Floor types: earthen, wood, concrete 
- Straw bale walls: structually insulated pannels, stick and frame with bales inside, 
- Energy collection: city utility, solar, wind
- Windows: Double, tripple, single pained windos

But one unique thing is cozy Scottish furnature you could add as your house is complete: 
- Rugs
- Kitchen appliances
- Couches
- Beds
- Chairs
- Enterainment (music playing things) 
- Books
- Coorie home kind of things

The game would also teach you about nature and give bonus points on using energy saving things.
