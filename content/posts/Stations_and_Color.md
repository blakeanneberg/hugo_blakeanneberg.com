Room colors and radio stations.

While these are not super related, I think about them alot.

The room colors I think about are a light green,light blue (or white) and a reddish color (or perhaps a golden aspen color). Another color pallet for a room would be the color of dried corn stocks, the dried red corn cob and yellow of dried corn seed. 

I think these colors would be great in interror rooms of a straw bale house. 

The radio stations I think aobut alot are Shonan Beach FM, SR.SE and DR.DK. I am so glad I have visited Japan (and the radio station), Sweden and Denmark. I even added Radio Free Minturn to my newest favorate app, called Shortwave, to the database: https://www.radio-browser.info/history/9bf25bec-389a-457c-80f8-ed455504f086 I am so glad I did. 

So someday I hope to have a house or a room that has these colors and listen to these radio stations.
