Today I learned that a Network tech coworker passed his CCNA. In the last couple of weeks and days I too have been studying the CCNA and I really like to see someone I know pass it. 

Basically I also purchased a video course on IP Subnetting, so I really am glad to have books, videos, Cisco Packet Tracer software and now a coworker to tap into for my learning. 

So I am now excited to learn.
