I thought I would just write down how much time and money I have spent for continuing education and professional development.

*   $349.00 for a lab simulator for Network+ [TestOut](https://w3.testout.com/courseware/network-pro) and I have not completed it for over a year.
*   $434.15 each year for 2+ years for Coursera Plus for [Google Project Management](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/EAD8CGS7VDSN) and [Google IT Support](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/SG9QTL4PHP8B)
*   Free access to Pluralsight via my work which took me around 3 months: Network Security Basics, VLAN Operation and Con figuration, Network Troubleshooting and Tools, Ethernet Operation and Switch Configuration, Network Management and Operations, Introduction Enterprise Network Infrastructure, Network Concepts and Protocols
*   Over $600 on other miscellaneous educational stuff over the last three years.

I failed to schedule and take the Network+ exam last year, I knew I would fail it. It really does require alot of real-world networking/hardware experience. I think the hardest thing about the Network+ was getting motivation to use my knowledge to create a home lab to practice what I was learning.

I also underestimated how much time Network+ study would take when it was not part of my daily work experience.

Otherwise, if I were to look into a physical or live/online class for Network+ certification, I would 100% start building a physical homelab to put what I am learning to work.

Right now I am using Coursera to do other courses in my spare time at night and on weekends for continuing education to get baseline certificates that expand my skills. These include:

*   Data Visualization with Tableau Specialization
*   Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate
*   Google Business Intelligence Professional Certificate
*   Learn SQL Basics for Data Science Specialization
*   Programming with Google Go Specialization
*   Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate
