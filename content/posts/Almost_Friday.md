I really like Fridays.

Some of the things I like about them are:

- Slightly more relaxed than other days of the week. 
- Chips and queso with cherry coke. 
- Playing video games like Civ or Starfield in the afternoon or evening. 
- Looking forward for a long run or long bike ride over the weekend.
- Half day Fridays are nice. 
- If the Friday is rainy or snowy, it feels really nice to be cozy inside. 

Anyway, I cant wait to play my own game on a Friday afternoon.
