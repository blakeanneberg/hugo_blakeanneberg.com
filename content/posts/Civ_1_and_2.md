I put Civ 1 and Civ 2 back on my surface pro. 

I dont know why, as I have Civ 1 on my Mac, but I just felt like I needed to play just one more turn.

I dont know why I think about it so much. I remmember playing it on a computer in the basement and the music and soundtrack, and the history I was learning by playing each civ. 

My main strategy is to just develop on one island or contenent and near the end when I have advanced tech I quickly take over the world. Otherwise I love having a couple cities and then do a space victory. 

If there was one game I would play forever, it really might be Civ 1 or Civ 2. 

My only gripes are not having automated settlers for improvements in Civ 1. 

I really hope in the coming year with Civ 7 that they re-release the Civ 1 and 2 so I can play it on the Steam Deck as well.
