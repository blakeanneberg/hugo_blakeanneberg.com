It was really nice to see a old course I made. It had a 4.2 star rating and had over 3000 students signed up. 

I had kinda forgotten about it. 

As I work on the video game, I am looking forward to having users and getting it online for people to learn about history, politics and transportation. 

I also look forward for people supporting the work and giving feedback. I hope the game will be much more interactive than the online course in making updates. 

Finally, I will need to add accessibility features from the course into the game. so I will have to probably take my old course to remember what I had said.
