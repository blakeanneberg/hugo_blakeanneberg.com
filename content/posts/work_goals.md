I have three short term work goals that I either do at night or work on when I dont have other things to do at work:

1.  Study the Data Analystics course by Google and copy down the job post I read about it to then get those skills.
2.  Create the project management template for initial conversations with stakeholders about projects with Hospitality IT.
3.  Figure out a project with Sustainability staff that would augment my development of a leadership skill.

I find having these goals as comforting as it gives me goals to attain and gives me confidence in knowing that I am learning new things.

However, I am working in other online courses at the same time, by learning about Python, Go, Tableau/Data visualization, SQL and other skills like Buseiness Presentations and hopefully converting this blog and website to Django or Go in the future.

I also forgot about CS50W... which I would love to finish and get a certifacte.
