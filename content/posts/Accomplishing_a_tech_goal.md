Since migrating this website, I am seeing what I used to have and what I have now. It reminded me that I also have an about page on Github. So when I looked at that I decided to move that over to the about page on this website. When reading it, I realized that I had a "Tech Goal" of "Creating a blog with either django or Go about my coding journey." 

Technically this new Hugo site is made with Go... so I feel like I accomplished it without actually writing Go. 

My next tech goal is to create the game that showcases a train or hyperloop system in Colorado. Hopefully I can get help with that so I can accomplish that goal too.
