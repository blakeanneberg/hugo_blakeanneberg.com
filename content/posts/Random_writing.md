I just need to write a post for today to keep my Stoic journey up in writing.

So I am trying to think of something random to write about. 

I am looking at my LED cancel, my smart speaker, a Danish flag, white water bottle, university coaster, phone charger holder and finally a blue pottery coorie home.

I think that sums me up pretty well. I could talk alot about each of the items, but this bedside table is exactly what I like to see when I go to sleep and wake up.
