When studding for the CCNA, alot of the material is foundational stuff on how networks work. But then I am learning alout about Cisco products at the same time. I dont know if I will every use the stuff I learn about Cisco though. So I dont know if if its Obsolete stuff with the Cisco focused product, as I might just use Ubiquity tech.

Then when I play Civ3, I wonder if its a obsolete game (just like how new researched tech can make old tech obsolete in Civ). Or is it a foundational game where then I can understand how a new Civ 7 is even "better" than the old civ game. 

Anyway, it was fun to play Civ3 again, and as I learn "Obsolete" stuff in my CCNA study... it might be fun to look back on that some daytoo.
