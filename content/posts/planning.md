Been thinking about planning lately. 

I need alot of planning. With projects like the video game, straw bale house and YouTube content creation for both of those projects, and other goals with my online courses. 

I am now trying to plan other things and I realized I have not saved enough to include them in any kind of timeline.

Like standing behind the finish line vs right in front of it, planning is really important.

I used to have a photo in my office of the Triple Constraint theory. Where in each corner you have a different aspect of a project with cost/budget, time and scope. And I have to trade between the corners. 

So planning is hard, I just didn't know I should have started earlier doing it.
