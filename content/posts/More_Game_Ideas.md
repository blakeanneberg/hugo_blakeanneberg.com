Well, I have more game ideas. 

Putting in CO Rail Game the idea about riding bikes, and even kayaking are enough to re-scope out the game, and I would love Sauna to go in there too.

What these two things would do is to closely align with European ideas of sustainable transportation, preserving nature, traveling across borders, and social responsibility and equality with Finnish Sauna ideas. 

"The Finish sauna is a great equalizer. It represents the non-hierarchical nature of Nordic society. There's even a saying that expresses the inclusively of this heated box: "Everyone is created equal, but nowhere more than in a sauna." from [Finland.fi](https://finland.fi/han/saunas/)

I think wrapping all these ideas into one game would be awesome. As I also want to personally go out there in real-life and do these things.

What I also wonder about are video game made by a social enterprises. A quick search brings up this ['Game changer': First Native-produced video game 'Never Alone' brings culture to the console](https://www.adn.com/culture/article/never-alone-video-game/2014/10/31/) and this [Wetopia, The Social Impact Social Game

So hopefully the CO Rail Game can do alot more than just be a video game.
