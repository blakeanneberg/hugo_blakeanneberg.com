I normally write about the big goals I have but some smaller goals are: 

- Learn how to do pull ups.
- Read more about stoic philosophy in my new book.
- Bike out to Parker and go to Fidd ka. 
- Start seeds.
- Sign up for marathons next year.
- Go see a Starship launch
- Try and do more boot.dev and Head First Go book.
- Attend more open air events this summer.
- Learn how to play golf, tennis, pickle ball. 
- Visit more CO cities. 
- Buy land... or at least find out what small plots are available.
- Run up the mountain more... and basically run 4 times a week. 
- Do more yoga or other workout classes. 
- Do more creative writing class.
- Learn how to do pottery. 
- Be outside more.
- Plant things. 

Otherwise I really really really like summer. Basically, I want to live part time in city and mountains. 

Also in Boot.dev, I am using the AI more so I at least enjoy learning how to code and not get so frustrated. 

I am liking my Go book to learn from... Makes me at least feel like I am working and progressing though a book even thought I might be learning as much as just doing it by my self.
