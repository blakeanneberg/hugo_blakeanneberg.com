I am really impressed with having the entire written collection of books on early possibly accessible from any device.

This weekend I purchased Stillness is the Key by Ryan Holiday and rented from the public library when Things Don't Go Your Way by Haemin Sunmin. Within seconds I had them on my phone, and tens of seconds I had them on my Kindle.

Its ironic that I Am also still studying networking in the CCNA as those technologies enabled me getting those book so fast. 

I read somewhere this week that Gen Z considers books as a waste of time. Its hard to believe this is true, since getting books has never been faster. 

I am looking forward to reading these books now, and taking as much time as I need to enjoy them.
