Well I am back from vacation and totally didnt work on anything. Some goals for next couple weeks:

- Perhaps sign up for a instructor run Network+ course...
- Do the UX/UI of the game.
- Do more online stuff like make a merch store for the game.
- I am looking forward to a straw bale workshop that I signed up for, but need to make a youtube channel and make some videos to then start up Coorie Home again.

While I was on vacation I learned alot of this:

- Did research on trains across countries.
- Talked to people about my goals and got some good ideas.
- Realized just how nice it is to live in Scandinavia, and how old houses were built with natural materials. 

So on a whole, while I did not do alot of computer stuff, I definitely thought alot about goals for the summer and the future, but need to make a YouTube channel and make some videos to then start up Coorie Home again.
