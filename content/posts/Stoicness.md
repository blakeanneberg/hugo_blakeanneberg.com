Not sure if its a word but going with it as a title.

I wanted to run commute this morning but didnt wake up early enough as my alarm was off.

I really wanted to run in the afternoon, but was so hungry as I didnt get lunch on time.

So now I have had dinner and did a bit of study and now going on a small run on treadmill. 

I think that is stoicness.
