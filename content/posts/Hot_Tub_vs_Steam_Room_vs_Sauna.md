Post-tourist rush, I finally got to enjoy the gym's amenities! Sadly, the sauna remains out of order, but I did test out the hot tub and steam room. Here's my quick ranking:

1. Sauna (with cold plunge): Best overall for feeling refreshed, especially with Saunagus.
2. Hot Tub: Excellent for pure relaxation and warming up.
3. Steam Room (with eucalyptus): Good, but needs eucalyptus spray to be truly enjoyable.

Fingers crossed the sauna gets fixed soon!
