Finally used both today after the hoards of tourists have ebbed, at one of my gyms. 
The sauna is still broken down here.

But I would rate them like this:

1. Sauna with Saunagus and a cold ocean or late to jump in after.
2. Hot tub as it really relaxing and warms you up.
3. Steam room, but have eucalyptus spray.  

Sauna is really hot, but going in to a cold plunge, it has the best time for ratio in it in feeling better afterwards.
