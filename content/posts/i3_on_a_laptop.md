I really enjoy using i3 to quickly go back and forth between workspaces, applications and windows. 

For Firefox I use Vimium shortcuts and this is super helpful pausing and playing videos for online learning. 

I sometimes need a calculator so I `ctrl` and `enter` to search for calculator and then I use the i3 keybindings to resize it between my other windows of online learning and neovim for taking notes.

the only bad thing is that I want a new laptop. The current one is so old, and the speakers are horrible for listening to the audio of the online course. Also the monitor is not very sharp.

So I continue to think about getting a System76 laptop... or a used Dell XPS. 

The only thing that might make laptop life easier, is I wish I had better integration with when I write blog posts, I could use Google's Gemini to proof read and make it somewhat better.
