I really like slow moving streams. I was walking next to Gore Creek and watched people on inter tubes float down the river. It was so hot and I wish I could sit in a inter tube.

But also I like the way they sound. Quiet stream noises make me want to go to sleep. 

So one project I really want to do as I have been thinking about it for so long is taking my camera and lav audio mics up on the mountain in quiet areas and recording stream and wind sounds. I really wanted to do this for each season but missed out on spring and early summer. Now in late summer I could do it but I would have to take a day off or something. I think having a hour of audio/video would be great. 

So next time I go to the home reno store I would like to buy a small water fountain for my room so I can test and relax from the comfort of my room.
