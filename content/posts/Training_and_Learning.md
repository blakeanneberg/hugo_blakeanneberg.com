Pretty much doing full time Ironman training and then squeezing any other time into Godot/Video Game learning. 

Three things I want to focus on is weight workouts... and Game Design Document mixed in with more tutorials on Godot from humble bumble. 

I also want to get a desk on wheels that can also be a standing desk. 

I have kinda given up on Network+ study as I just don't have time.

I think i need to wake up earlier in the day and then have dedicated schedules. 

Anyway looking forward late August when Ironman will be done.
