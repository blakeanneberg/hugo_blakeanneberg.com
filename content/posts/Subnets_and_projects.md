While I study subnets, I cant help but think about other projects at work.

I still remember wanting to have a template that can be used for any project, great or small. 

The template would be like a pager and then I would fill it out if anybody would ask for something. 

I also think back to my slide writing course and how I wish I had finished it and taken more notes. 

I like learning about subnets as I find that people who think they know about subnets don't really know enough about it, so I want to be able to know myself and not rely on their faulty knowledge. 

So goals are: 
1. finish subnet course
2. re-take the slide writing course
3. have more confidence with my technical knowledge
