The plan was to run to the pool and then swim, but then it started to look rainy. By the time I made it in the pool it was starting to rain. 

I was glad to not be running in the rain.

What you might not know is if its raining over a large body of water, each rain droplets bounce upward in the pool as the surface tension of water breaks gravity. A echo of the initial hit. 

These droplets are far less dramatic when looking under the water, upward to the sky. 

After being memorized by the droplets, I came back went on a run. Yet again I was amazed by the massive size of the moon breaking the limb of the mountain ridge. It felt like something out of Starfield, an alien moon rising above an alien hill, with an alien forest.
