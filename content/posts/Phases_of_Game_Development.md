I didn't really know phases till I was in them. Trying to think of these phases and be able to have a successful game.

Phase 0.
1. Have idea.
2. Reach out to group to see if they can help.
3. They reply back that they can help and scope out idea.
4. Group proposes phases.

Phase 1.
1. Group breaks up dev into two Phases.
2. Phase 1 will have UXUI and game engine/flow scoped out, as well as content of game figured out.
*We are here now*
3. Start to think about funding Phase 2.

Phase 2. 
1. Group decides MVP and other features for development phases.
2. Crowdfund further phases???

Phase 3.
1. Release...?

Phase 4. 
1. Work on the expansion of new game content.  

Without knowing about phase, it would have been hard to expect what comes next, and know when to stop work on one phase and move to the other.
