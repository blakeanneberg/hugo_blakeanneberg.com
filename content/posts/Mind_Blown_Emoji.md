I had two mind blown emoji points today...

First was in Neovim when you can put a curser on a word and press `shift` and `3` or `#` which highlight all instances of the work with a key stroke. 

Second was learning about DDNS when the device doesnt have a IP address and is behind a network. 

I cant wait to learn more about DDNS and get better with Neovim.
