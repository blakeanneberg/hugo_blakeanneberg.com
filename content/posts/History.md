I learned about Amor Fati, which loosly means to accpt and embrace fate in all aspects of life. 

I think this is different from manafiestation, but it has more to do with feelings. How you control how you feel and do about what happens to you. You take control over perceptions.

So how does amor fati have to do with history? I am not sure, but in seeing the old mining towns, rail roads that went bancrupt and towns that went bust, I wonder what percentage of them thought they were wishing for a different fate, or just accepted fate.
