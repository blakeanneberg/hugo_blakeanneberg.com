I learned about Amor Fati, which loosely means to accept and embrace fate in all aspects of life. 

I think this is different from manifestation, but it has more to do with feelings. How you control how you feel and no matter what happens to you. You take control over perceptions and you basically say that's great and move on.

So how does amor fati have to do with history? I am not sure, but in seeing the old prospector pits with mining tailings, rail roads that went bankrupt and towns that went bust, I wonder what percentage of them thought they were wishing for a different fate, or just accepted fate.
