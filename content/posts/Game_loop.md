I am so glad I hired the team to help make the game. 

I was starting to feel a bit nervious that we needed to re-visualize the game loop, and today they made the game loop with other information too.

We figured out the four main personas/people that you will play as.

We figured out the four main game lopps: historical, food, nature and social. 

So now I am going to research over the weekend how to make dialog between the players charactor and NPC's. 

This is exciting!
