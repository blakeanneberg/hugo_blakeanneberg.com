I am plugging away in studying for the CCNA. I get the feeling though that this STP/RSTP and EtherChannel configuration is difficult.

I need to use the virtual Pearsons CCNA Simulator alot more. Logging into and out of switches and interfaces takes a bit of muscle memory. 

I also need to re-study my Subnetting skills as I got it somewhat down, but I really need a re-fresher.

Basically, more study will be good. Luckily I found I bunch of Cisco switches in a closet so I can use those as practice.
