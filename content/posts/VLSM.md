As I learn more about networking, I really need to apply it. I have some hardware to use to learn how to do it but I also have some software that can emulate networks. 

Cant wait to also jump back into my books for the CCNA from this side course on subnetting that I figured would be a great resource to learn some of the hardest things in networking. 

It should give me a great foundation to understand networks. When I learn about VLSM, it will require me to use what I have learned from the simple math, which is hard to remember when I do not practice it. So I need to figure out a way to keep my skills sharp.
