I am really looking forward to two purchases I recently made.

Both have been on my mind for a while. 

First is a salt-shaker like canisters that have different kind of seeds in them and other is a large digital picture frame.  

I really hope the shaker can spread a ton of flowers in the spring.

And I like the big format of the photo frame, and it will be fun to see photos more regularly.
