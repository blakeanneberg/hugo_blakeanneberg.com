So I am finally getting back to study CCNA, but I forgot that I was still on the STP and RSTP chapter. 

Its so long. 

I also cant help but think that companies Ubiquity and Unifi solution make studding this knowledge kinda redundant... but I still want to continue the study as it gives me a foundational view of networking. 

I also am thinking that it might change if I take the CCNA, as I really don't need to right now. 

Actually, I think studying boot.dev might now be more important as that could help with "Automation" and "Redundancy" that I am striving for at work. 

Will need to write about that in a separate post.
