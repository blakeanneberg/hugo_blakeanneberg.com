I finally hit 1000 lines of notes in my CCNA Markdown file. 

I haven't been good with taking notes lately as I have been focusing on triathlon training and the rail game. 

I also am getting closer to the point of getting into subnetting, which I cant wait to re-learn as its everywhere and is so important. 

I also cant wait to do more Pearsons Network Simulator. 

I just wanted to celebrate this milestone as its taken me a while to keep at it and take notes.
