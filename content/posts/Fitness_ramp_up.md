Its really interesting to see Strava data from years ago. 

I can see how I was performing in the phone app for a max of 2 years ago.

My goals this year is to get a solid base. 

In previous years I did a ladder style treadmill running plan. Each week I increase millage. I think I have been doing 4ish mile last week. Need to increase it to 5 miles this week.

Additionally, this year I am going to more run commutes to get a easy 2-4 miles in every day, on top of treadmill time.

For swimming I have set the goal to do 1500 per swim... and I really should increase that too. 

For biking... I still need to get the trainer out of storage.
