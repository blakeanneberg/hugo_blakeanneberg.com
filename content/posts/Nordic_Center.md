Going to the Nordic center is always nice. 

I know one person over there and its nice to talk to him and hear about all things Nordic skiing. Also I like the clothing which is also what I wear for skinning. 

Last night it snowed a bit, so it was almost enough to try classic skiing. 

When the trail officially opens, the restaurant opens and sells unlimited soup, which is nice after being cold.
