In studding for the CCNA, I am using a host of resources. Simulator software, real Cisco hardware, textbooks and online exams. 

I am trying to put a full court press in learning the materials. I am glad I finished my IP Subnetting online course but now when I am turning to the textbooks, I am finding that I have so many other resources. 

One such resource is the PTP practice exam, as I just took about 10 questions and only got one correct.

It really dawned on me the vast amount of knowledge I will need to learn, but I am not afraid of failing in all my practice exams.
