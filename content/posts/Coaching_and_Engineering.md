I am glad to find two things: Triathlon Coaches and Engineers. 

The first one is pretty easy to understand as I train for Ironman Copenhagen, the second one is about the CO Rail game. 

The Coach to make the plan (which I will commit and execute) for getting into shape and learning how to use nutrition to prevent bonks. 

The Engineer will get the work from the design team and me and will get it built. 

I don't think I could do all the work by myself in being both the coach and engineer.
