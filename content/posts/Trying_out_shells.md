Currently using Alacritty but did try out Warp, but it had to much unused space. I usually use iTerm as my regular Terminal app broke with my NeoVim font settings.

Want to have a low power terminal, and be able to try something new. So far I am liking Warp.

With Warp, I also found that I didnt need all the features as all you really need to know is TMUX.
