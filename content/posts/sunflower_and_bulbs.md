I like seeing sunflower seeds that grow into big sunflowers and annual bulbs grow into hundreds of flowers. 

Its starting to be that time of year I see bulbs on sale and thing about what I can grow next year. 

Its also that time of year Coursera renews and I think of what courses I want to learn.

I am also looking into a cyber cert to reinforce my networking knoweldge. But like every online course I look into I need to figure out if I have time for them.
