I really like my video game music. Whether it was Civ 1 or 2 or later or Doom soundtrack or newer games, its just wonderful.

I often listen to it when working out and I sometimes think people don't often listen to this great music as they do not play any games. 

I also like listening to DR.DK/LYD and SR.SE and used to listen to BNN.FM and ShonanBeachFM. 

Otherwise I just love it and am so glad there are such great songs out there.
