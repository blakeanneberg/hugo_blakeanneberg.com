I have alot of mixed feelings. 

I went down the rabbit hole of learning about Civ3 and I basically forgot how cool it was.

Its so different from Civ1 and Civ2, and in my brief time today playing it, it was really enjoyable. It fixes alot of what I don't like about Civ1 (mainly how improvements to tiles requires so much work) and Civ2 (more debt and content and features). 

So when I consider buying Civ7 and which version to buy, I cant help but to think about these older games which I might not have played very much of.

I also think how much time I have spent playing them. Grinding though the early game eras... and hardly playing any late game content. 

I just don't know if I should pre-order the game. I have been burnt by Cities Skylines 2, and other games so much hat I just know that pre-ordering is not a good idea.

But it is Civ, and being able to play it would be fun. I should put time caps on how much I play it too, but I also am really looking forward to playing it on Steam Deck. 

Also unrelated, its been eye opening to be able to work in a place that has arcade games and lots of media TV and LED screens. I don't think I would ever want a arcade in my small cafe... I would want TV's and computer games being broadcast and for people to come in and play games too.
