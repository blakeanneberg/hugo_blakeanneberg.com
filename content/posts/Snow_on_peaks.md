As I look across reservoir "lake" Dillon, I see above treeline snow.  Its both great to see but ominous to know that winter is coming. 

Very relieved to have a plan on the video game as well. However I will have to increase the project cost and scope with the crowdfunding campaign. 

So with excitement of front page Vail Daily articles about western slope passenger rail lines, and how the video game will help those dreams, I  know it will be a long winter and spring is far off.
