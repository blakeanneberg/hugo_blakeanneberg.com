For some time I have been wanting to have a in person store that sells Saysky clothing, has coffee/snacks and sells scandi/local stuff.

In the store I could also have nice cups as I see a similarity between Royal Copenhagen porcelain and Saysky running clothes and celebrates educational video games and shows space events live.

The Royal Copenhagen and Saysky connection are:

1. Both have seasonal designs, patterns and run for a limited time.
2. Both are luxury life style brands. They run pretty expensive. 
3. They do not often bring back designs.
4. Both lean into their Scandinavian heritage. 

The video game and space shows connection are that I have also been thinking that I can do some part time work in educational video game niche and having space events on TV/Projected could be better than showing regular sports. 

The educational video game guiding plan could be this: 

- Finish the CO Rail game UXIU. 
- Start a crowdfunding campaign for dev costs and to get interest. Release on steam?
- The first theme will be current day in Colorado
- Second theme will be historical in Colorado
- Third theme would be futuristic in Colorado
- Fourth theme would be a current day journey in Ukraine  
- Fifth theme would be historical in Japan (shinkansen)
- Sixth theme would be futuristic in Europe with a hyperloop by Hardt or SwissPod

Finally, the goal would be a store where I could build it with straw bale methods, and then live above the store. Not sure where the organic pool would go, but glad to figure out a start from just running clothes.
