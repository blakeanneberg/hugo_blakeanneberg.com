After buying flights for CPH and HEL for marathons, I want to book flights to other places too, including places I have been to:

- Tokyo and Fukushima to eat food and see rural places
- Iceland to see lava and spas
- Scotland to run, spa, eat and drink and relax
- AU/NZ to have fun.

And other places I have not been:

- Hamburg or Rotterdam for Marathon 
- Greece for food and history... and marathon
- Hawaii or for palm trees 

So ya, it would be fun to fly more.
