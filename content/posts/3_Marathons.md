I am really looking forward to three races. 

1. Madrid: I cant wait to go back. I just cant wait. I cant believe it either. 
2. Copenhagen: I cant say much more than I am stoked.
3. Helsinki: Will round out completing marathons around Scandinavia.  

This kinda blows my mind. 

I am so excited.

I wont go to fast but that's okay. I am there just to run. :)
