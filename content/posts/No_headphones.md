I forgot to get my headphones for the long bike ride. But I really enjoyed just hearing the bird song in the parks, the other noises of biking and just being present.

I know during races, headphones are discouraged. But I think Ill try and use headphones less for training. 

With 'No Headphones' I also think I could do away with less phone use, less YouTube, less Reddit, and more game dev study, more reading books, more time doing things I want to do like going outside.
