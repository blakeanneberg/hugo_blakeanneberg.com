Today I moved a switch and NVR, created a new VLAN for duplicating a new SSID and then did a ton of cable management. 

I would say most of what I did was just from learning. The the VLAN and SSID could be considered something I studied for... but I would say its about 15%. 

So as I study for the CCNA, consider studying for the AZ-800 Administering Windows Server Hybrid Core Infrastructure and Boot.dev Python (when I get around to re-studding)... I wonder if the percentage of this study will still be 15% of what I actually do day to day. It feels like alot to study. 

What I look forward to this year is learning about gardening, building a video game with a team, building a straw bale house, doing two marathons and a Ironman. This is alot to undertake, but I feel it will be fun.
