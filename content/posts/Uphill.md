I honestly didn't think the path was plowed all the way. 

I had first thought I would do a out and back. What I did not expect once I started was loops, water hazards, and just continuing uphill. 

There were a couple other uphill moments. The fact that I was recovering from being sick, missing workouts and combining two into one, and then not knowing how to dress as it was cold and windy.

I ran out of water, my wool shirt got soaking from sweat, and I was having a hard time finding good music. 

This was just a uphill day. To cap it off I ended the run not at 20, but rather 19.98. That .02 was the uphill tax.
