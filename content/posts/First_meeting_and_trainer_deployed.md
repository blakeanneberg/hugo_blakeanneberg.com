Glad to have the first re-kickoff meeting for the CO Rail game... and I am still 100% glad to be doing the project... Epically these days.

- I will have to wake up for the meeting that starts at 7AM. 
- The game will be designed to be able to incorporate different locations around the world... and different cultures.
- I will have to work hard to keep the work progressing. 

Next, I got my bike trainer out of storage and literally set up next to my bed. I was too tired to do a training session on it, but it will be warmer than the storage room to exercise in and I don't think the vibration will be too bad though the floor. I do eventually want to put it back in the storage room though... as then I can blast music.

These next months till August will be busy. Some of the projects are:

- Marathon/Ultra training
- Ironman training
- CCNA study
- Boot.Dev study (to finish it in this year!) 
- Study Danish
- Garden more

I am probably forgetting more but I am really excited to start this journey.
