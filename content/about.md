# Learning to Code.

I am using tools like Neovim, Coursera courses and github to develop this website.
I have been learning code for many years now, and it has been helpfull in my various jobs and projects.
My goal is to have a hyperloop inspired landing, where the visitor will see a map of moving hyperloop pods.

Random fact: I love Civilization 1.
